# Deck Formatting Task (Paused)

This file contains the instructions to resume the deck formatting task.

**Goal:** To reformat all deck files in the project to a new, standardized format.

**Standard:**
*   Detailed guide format (similar to `commander_decks/YidrisChaos/yidris_deck_guide.md`).
*   Markdown compatible with Windows 11 Notepad (no `---` or ` ``` `).
*   Windows-style line endings (`\r\n`).
*   A plain text copy/paste section at the end of the file.

**To Resume:**
The current progress of the task is tracked in the `write_todos` list. To resume, simply ask me to continue the deck formatting task, and I will pick up where I left off based on the TODO list.
