# The First Sliver Deck Guide: "Current Value Engine"

## Deck Strategy
**Archetype:** 5-Color Cascade Value
**Format:** Historic

*   **Goal:** This deck aims to win through overwhelming value and a flexible, interactive game plan. The goal is to control the early game with cheap removal and counterspells, ramp into powerful threats, and use The First Sliver's cascade ability to generate a continuous stream of value and build a dominant board presence.
*   **How it Plays:** This is a "5-Color Good Stuff" deck. You will spend the early turns interacting with your opponent, disrupting their plan while developing your own mana. In the mid-game, you'll start deploying powerful creatures and planeswalkers. Once you cast The First Sliver, each subsequent cascade will help you pull further ahead, eventually overwhelming your opponent with a board full of threats.

## 1. The Commander
*   **The First Sliver:** The ultimate value engine. In this deck, its cascade ability is used to hit a wide range of powerful spells, from ramp and removal to game-ending threats.

## 2. Ramp & Mana Fixing
*A comprehensive package to ensure you can cast your spells on time in a 5-color deck.*
*   **Mana Dorks (Paradise Druid, Ornithopter of Paradise):** Cheap creatures that tap for mana.
*   **Ramp Spells (Cultivate, Growth Spiral, Farseek):** Spells that search for lands and accelerate your mana development.
*   **Mana Rocks (Arcane Signet, Chromatic Lantern, Skyclave Relic):** Artifacts that tap for mana and fix your colors.
*   **Dryad of the Ilysian Grove / The World Tree:** Powerful enchantments that turn all of your lands into "rainbow" lands, solving all mana-fixing issues.

## 3. Tutors & Card Advantage
*A powerful suite of tutors to find the exact card you need for any situation.*
*   **Beseech the Mirror:** A powerful tutor that can put a spell directly onto the stack if you have a high enough bargain cost.
*   **Solve the Equation:** A tutor specifically for instants or sorceries.
*   **The One Ring:** An incredible source of card draw that also provides protection.
*   **Rusko, Clockmaker:** A creature that generates a stream of artifact tokens.

## 4. The Payoffs & Win-Conditions
*The powerful threats that will close out the game.*
*   **Omniscience / One with the Multiverse:** The best possible hits from a cascade, allowing you to cast spells from your hand for free.
*   **Etali, Primal Conqueror / Jin-Gitaxias, Progress Tyrant:** Massive creatures that generate huge value and can take over the game.
*   **Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger:** A game-ending Eldrazi titan.
*   **Portal to Phyrexia:** A powerful artifact that reanimates creatures from any graveyard each turn.
*   **Ultimatums (Emergent, Genesis, Ruinous):** Powerful, game-ending spells.
*   **Extra Turn Spells (Time Warp, Karn's Temporal Sundering, A-Alrund's Epiphany):** Taking an extra turn is often enough to secure a victory.

## 5. Interaction & Removal
*A suite of efficient spells to control the board.*
*   **Board Wipes (Farewell, Supreme Verdict):** Powerful spells to reset the board.
*   **Targeted Removal (The Cruelty of Gix, Binding the Old Gods, Casualties of War):** Versatile sagas and spells that can deal with multiple types of permanents.
