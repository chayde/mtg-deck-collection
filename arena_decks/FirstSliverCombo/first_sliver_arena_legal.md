# The First Sliver Deck Guide: "Arena Casino Combo"

## Deck Strategy
**Archetype:** Cascade Combo ("Sliver-less Sliver")
**Format:** Historic (MTG Arena)

*   **Goal:** This is a "glass cannon" combo deck that aims to cheat a massive, game-winning spell into play as early as turn 3 or 4. It does not play like a normal Magic deck and mulligans very aggressively to find a hand that can execute the combo.
*   **The Combo:** The entire deck is built around a single, guaranteed interaction:
    1.  Your commander is **The First Sliver**, which has Cascade.
    2.  The **only** other card in the entire 99-card deck with a mana value less than 5 is **Tibalt's Trickery**.
    3.  You cast The First Sliver. Its Cascade ability triggers and looks for the first spell in your library with a mana value less than 5. Because Tibalt's Trickery is the only legal target, you are **guaranteed** to hit it.
    4.  You cast Tibalt's Trickery for free, targeting your own First Sliver spell on the stack.
    5.  Tibalt's Trickery counters your First Sliver, but its main effect triggers: you mill 1, 2, or 3 cards, then exile cards from the top of your library until you exile a nonland card. You may cast that card for free.
    6.  Since every other nonland card in the deck is a huge, game-ending threat, you are guaranteed to cast a "Payoff" card for free. This often results in an immediate win.

## 1. The Combo Pieces
*The two essential cards that make the entire deck function.*
*   **The First Sliver:** Your commander. Its role is simply to be a 5-mana spell with Cascade that you can always cast from the command zone. It will almost never resolve.
*   **Tibalt's Trickery:** The engine. This is the only card in the deck with a mana cost less than 5, making it the guaranteed target for The First Sliver's cascade.

## 2. The Payoffs
*These are the massive, game-winning spells you are hoping to hit with Tibalt's Trickery. Hitting any one of these usually leads to a win.*
*   **Omniscience / One with the Multiverse:** The absolute best cards to hit. They allow you to cast every other spell from your hand (and sometimes library) for free, leading to an immediate and overwhelming board state.
*   **Apex Devastator / Maelstrom Wanderer:** Creatures that have Cascade themselves, leading to even more free spells and a massive board presence.
*   **Atraxa, Grand Unifier / Emergent Ultimatum / Brilliant Ultimatum:** Powerful spells that generate immense value, drawing you more cards or putting multiple threats onto the battlefield.
*   **Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger / Emrakul, the Promised End / Kozilek, the Great Distortion:** Eldrazi titans. These are massive, game-ending threats that are incredibly difficult for your opponent to deal with.
*   **Etali, Primal Conqueror / Etali, Primal Storm:** Creatures that let you cast spells from the top of both your and your opponent's libraries for free.
*   **Dragonstorm / Hit the Mother Lode / Dance with Calamity:** Spells that can generate a huge number of tokens or cast multiple spells from your library.

## 3. The Mana Base
*The mana base is the third, silent part of the combo. Since the deck has no card draw or cheap spells, it must be built to consistently have 5 mana of all 5 colors by turn 4 or 5.*
*   **58 Lands:** An unusually high land count is necessary to ensure you make your land drops every single turn.
*   **Triomes (e.g., Ketria Triome, Zagoth Triome):** The most important lands in the deck. They tap for three different colors of mana.
*   **Fetch Lands (e.g., Bloodstained Mire, Flooded Strand):** These lands can search for any land with a basic land type, which includes all the Triomes and Shock Lands, guaranteeing perfect mana fixing.
*   **"Rainbow" Lands (e.g., Mana Confluence, Gemstone Mine, The World Tree):** Lands that can tap for any color of mana.
*   **Channel Lands (e.g., Boseiju, Otawara):** These provide utility and can be discarded to deal with problematic permanents without needing to be cast.
