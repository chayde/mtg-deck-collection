1 Virtue of Persistence // (Adventure MV 2... DANGER. Do not use Adventure cards with MV < 5 if casting Trickery)
// CORRECTION: Tibalt's Trickery casts the spell. Beanstalk Giant is safe.
// BUT The First Sliver Cascade sees the card.
// Rule: Cascade checks the CARD's mana value. Beanstalk Giant is 7. Safe.
// However, Tibalt's Trickery allows you to cast it.
// Adventure Rules: You can cast the Adventure part.
// But we want BIG impacts.

// --- The Mana Base (42 Lands) ---
// NO MANA ROCKS (Sol Ring, Arcane Signet are BANNED in this deck)
// You need to hit 5 lands naturally.
