# The First Sliver Deck Guide: "Tibalt's Casino Combo"

## Deck Strategy
**Archetype:** Cascade Combo
**Format:** Historic

*   **Goal:** This is an "all-in" combo deck that aims to cheat a massive, game-winning spell into play as early as turn 5. The entire deck is constructed to make this combo as consistent as possible.
*   **The Combo:** The deck is built around a single, guaranteed interaction:
    1.  Your commander is **The First Sliver**, which has Cascade.
    2.  The **only** non-land card in the entire deck with a mana value less than 5 is **Tibalt's Trickery**.
    3.  You cast The First Sliver. Its Cascade ability triggers and, since Tibalt's Trickery is the only legal target, you are **guaranteed** to hit it.
    4.  You cast Tibalt's Trickery for free, targeting your own First Sliver.
    5.  Tibalt's Trickery counters your First Sliver and lets you exile cards from the top of your library until you hit a non-land card, which you can then cast for free.
    6.  Since every other non-land card is a huge "Payoff," you are guaranteed to put a game-ending threat onto the battlefield.

## 1. The Combo Pieces
*   **The First Sliver:** Your commander. Its only role is to be a 5-mana spell with Cascade that you can always cast.
*   **Tibalt's Trickery:** The engine. This is the only card in the deck with a mana cost less than 5, making it the guaranteed target.

## 2. The Payoffs
*The massive, game-winning spells you are hoping to hit with Tibalt's Trickery. This list uses the powerful spells you already own.*
*   **Etali, Primal Conqueror:** An incredible threat that casts free spells from both players' libraries.
*   **Imoti, Celebrant of Bounty:** Gives your other big spells cascade.
*   **Trumpeting Carnosaur:** A big body that can also act as removal.
*   **Atraxa, Grand Unifier:** Refills your hand with a huge number of cards.
*   **Emrakul, the Promised End / Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger:** Game-ending Eldrazi titans.
*   **Emergent Ultimatum:** A spell that lets you cast two of three powerful mono-colored spells for free.
*   **Omniscience / One with the Multiverse:** The best possible hits, allowing you to cast spells from your hand for free.
*   **Ugin's Labyrinth:** A land that can also be a mana source.
*   **Etali, Primal Storm:** A budget-friendly threat that casts spells from the top of each player's library.
*   **Brass's Bounty:** Can create a huge number of treasure tokens, giving you a massive mana advantage.
*   **Gilded Lotus / Chromatic Orrery:** Powerful mana rocks that ramp you significantly if you hit them.

## 3. The Mana Base
*The deck runs a high land count and zero mana rocks to ensure the combo is not interrupted.*
*   **Triomes, Shock Lands, and Fetch Lands:** The core of the mana base, providing perfect 5-color fixing.
*   **"Rainbow" Lands (Command Tower, Mana Confluence, etc.):** Ensure you can cast The First Sliver on turn 5.

## Upgrades & Budget Options

*This section lists potential upgrades if you acquire the wildcards, and budget-friendly fillers.*

*   **High-Priority Crafting Targets:**
    *   Ulamog, the Infinite Gyre
    *   Kozilek, Butcher of Truth
    *   Jin-Gitaxias, Core Augur
    *   Portal to Phyrexia
    *   Cityscape Leveler
    *   Koma, Cosmos Serpent
    *   Ruinous Ultimatum
    *   Genesis Ultimatum
*   **Budget Filler (Any non-land card with Mana Value 5+):**
    *   Annoyed Altisaur
    *   Maelstrom Colossus
    *   Boarding Party
    *   Titanoth Rex
    *   Beanstalk Giant (The adventure has a low MV, but the card itself is 7, so it is safe for the combo)
