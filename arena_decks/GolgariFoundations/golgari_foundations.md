# Golgari Foundations Deck Guide: "Budget Aristocrats"

## Deck Strategy
**Archetype:** Golgari (Black/Green) Aristocrats
**Format:** Budget / Starter Deck

*   **Goal:** This deck is built around the "aristocrats" strategy, which involves sacrificing your own creatures for value. The goal is to build a wide board of small, expendable creatures, and then use "sacrifice outlets" to trade them for damage, card draw, or other benefits, eventually overwhelming your opponent.
*   **How it Plays:** You'll spend the early game developing your board with cheap creatures and token generators. In the mid-game, you'll start using your sacrifice outlets like "Vampiric Rites" to control the board and generate value. The deck is resilient, with several ways to bring your creatures back from the graveyard, allowing you to continue your sacrifice plan turn after turn.

## 1. Token Generators
*These cards create the small, expendable creatures that fuel your sacrifice plan.*
*   **Wardens of the Cycle:** When it dies, it creates two 1/1 Spirit tokens, giving you more bodies to sacrifice.
*   **Eager Trufflesnout:** Creates a Food token when it enters, which can be used for lifegain or as a sacrifice target itself.
*   **Needletooth Pack:** When it dies, it creates a 1/1 Insect token.
*   **Cackling Prowler:** Can be kicked to create a 1/1 Bat token.

## 2. Sacrifice Outlets & Payoffs
*These cards are the heart of the deck, allowing you to sacrifice your creatures for profit.*
*   **Midnight Reaper:** A powerful engine that draws you a card whenever one of your non-token creatures dies.
*   **Vampiric Rites:** A key enchantment that lets you pay mana and sacrifice a creature to draw a card and gain life.
*   **Infernal Vessel:** An artifact that collects soul counters when your creatures die, which can then be used to generate a large amount of mana.
*   **Spinner of Souls:** Provides a steady stream of lifegain whenever one of your creatures dies.

## 3. Recursion & Resilience
*These cards help you bring your creatures back from the graveyard to be sacrificed again.*
*   **Reassembling Skeleton:** A classic recursive threat. You can pay mana to return it from your graveyard to the battlefield, providing a never-ending source of sacrifice fodder.
*   **Undying Malice:** An instant that can save one of your creatures from removal and brings it back with a +1/+1 counter.
*   **Infestation Sage:** Can be cast from your graveyard as long as you control a creature.

## 4. Removal
*Spells to control the board and deal with your opponent's threats.*
*   **Eaten Alive:** A cheap removal spell that can exile a creature or planeswalker.
*   **Felling Blow:** A removal spell that also gains you life if the creature had 4 or more power.
*   **Tragic Banshee:** Can destroy a creature, but at the cost of some life.

## 5. The Mana Base
*A simple, budget-friendly mana base.*
*   **Golgari Guildgate / Jungle Hollow:** "Tap lands" that provide both of your colors.
*   **Temple of Malady:** A dual land that also lets you Scry 1 when it enters.
