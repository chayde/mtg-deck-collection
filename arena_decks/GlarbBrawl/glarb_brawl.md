# Glarb, Calamity's Augur Deck Guide (Custom Commander)

**A Note on the Commander:** "Glarb, Calamity's Augur" is a custom, non-official commander. Based on the deck's construction, we can infer its abilities are focused on playing cards from the top of the library and interacting with the graveyard.

## Deck Strategy
**Archetype:** Sultai (Blue/Black/Green) Midrange/Value
**Format:** Standard Brawl

*   **Goal:** This deck is a value-oriented midrange deck built to leverage its commander's presumed abilities. The strategy is to ramp into Glarb, then use its abilities to play cards from the top of the library and recur threats from the graveyard, generating overwhelming value over the course of the game.
*   **How it Plays:** The deck spends the early game ramping and controlling the board with removal. Once Glarb is in play, it becomes a value engine. The deck has a strong "top-deck matters" sub-theme with cards like "Up the Beanstalk" and a graveyard recursion sub-theme with cards like "The Gitrog, Ravenous Ride," creating a resilient and powerful strategy.

## 1. The Commander
*   **Glarb, Calamity's Augur:** The central engine of the deck. Its presumed abilities allow you to play cards from the top of your library and utilize your graveyard, providing a steady stream of card advantage.

## 2. Ramp & Mana Fixing
*A solid package of ramp to cast Glarb and other expensive spells ahead of schedule.*
*   **Llanowar Elves / Hardroot Herbalist:** Classic one and two-mana dorks that provide early mana acceleration.
*   **The Mana Base:** A mix of dual lands, including "Verge" and "Restless" lands, to ensure you have all three of your colors when you need them.

## 3. Top-Deck & Graveyard Synergy
*These cards work directly with the deck's primary themes.*
*   **Aftermath Analyst:** Fills your graveyard and can later sacrifice itself to return all land cards from your graveyard to the battlefield.
*   **Caustic Bronco:** Allows you to look at the top card of your library and, if it's a land, put it into your hand. If it's not a land, you can deal damage equal to its mana value.
*   **Up the Beanstalk:** A powerful enchantment that draws you a card whenever you cast a spell with mana value 5 or greater.
*   **The Gitrog, Ravenous Ride:** A massive threat that can sacrifice creatures to draw cards and put lands into play from your hand. It also has a powerful recursive ability.
*   **Virtue of Persistence:** A removal spell that can be cast from the graveyard as an enchantment that reanimates a creature every turn.

## 4. Threats & Win-Conditions
*The powerful creatures that will close out the game.*
*   **Mosswood Dreadknight:** A resilient threat that can be cast from the graveyard as an adventure.
*   **Sentinel of the Nameless City:** A solid body that creates Map tokens, which can help you find lands or grow your creatures.
*   **Preacher of the Schism:** A must-answer threat that generates value every time it attacks.
*   **Overlords (Floodpits, Hauntwoods, Balemirk):** A cycle of powerful creatures that can take over the game if left unanswered.
*   **Aclazotz, Deepest Betrayal:** A flying, indestructible demon that forces your opponents to discard cards and can transform into a land.
*   **Bonny Pall, Clearcutter:** A large creature that creates Paul Bunyan's Ox, another massive threat.

## 5. Removal & Interaction
*A suite of efficient spells to control the board.*
*   **Shoot the Sheriff / Bitter Triumph / Murder:** A solid package of single-target removal spells.
*   **Withering Torment / Deadly Cover-Up:** Powerful board wipes to reset the board.
*   **Phantom Interference / Negate / Tishana's Tidebinder:** Counterspells to interact with your opponent on the stack.
