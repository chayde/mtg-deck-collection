# Atraxa, Grand Unifier Deck Guide: "The Great Unifier's Value Engine"

## Commander Strategy
**Atraxa, Grand Unifier**
*   **Role:** The Ultimate Value Engine.
*   **Goal:** The primary goal of this deck is to ramp into Atraxa as quickly as possible. Her enter-the-battlefield (ETB) ability is one of the most powerful in the game, allowing you to look at the top ten cards of your library and put one of each card type into your hand. This single ability can refill your hand with gas and overwhelm your opponents with card advantage.
*   **The Deck's Strategy:** This is a "4-Color Good Stuff" control deck. It plays a collection of the most powerful and efficient cards in White, Blue, Black, and Green. The deck aims to control the early game with cheap removal and counterspells, ramp into Atraxa, and then use the cards she provides to close out the game. There is a small "flicker" sub-theme to abuse Atraxa's ETB effect multiple times.

## 1. The Value Engine (Card Advantage & Tutors)
*These cards help you find what you need and keep your hand full.*
*   **A-The One Ring:** An incredibly powerful card advantage engine that also provides protection for a turn.
*   **Narset, Parter of Veils:** Restricts your opponents' card draw and helps you dig for non-creature spells.
*   **Grim Tutor:** A straightforward tutor that lets you find any card in your deck.
*   **Consider:** A cheap cantrip that helps you filter your draws and fuel your graveyard.
*   **Oracle of the Alpha:** A powerful creature that lets you cast some of the most broken spells in Magic's history for free.
*   **Rusko, Clockmaker:** A creature that generates a stream of artifact creatures that can be used for defense or mana.
*   **Tamiyo, Collector of Tales:** A planeswalker that can return cards from your graveyard to your hand and helps you find what you need.

## 2. Creature-Based Value
*These creatures provide powerful effects just by being on the battlefield.*
*   **Delighted Halfling:** A mana dork that also makes your commander uncounterable.
*   **Gilded Goose:** A flexible one-drop that can create food for lifegain or ramp you.
*   **Elesh Norn, Mother of Machines:** Doubles your ETB effects (like Atraxa's!) while shutting down your opponents'. A must-remove threat for your opponents.
*   **Sheoldred, the Apocalypse:** A powerful creature that provides a steady stream of life gain and damage while also being a formidable blocker.
*   **A-Orcish Bowmasters:** A flash creature that can punish your opponents for drawing cards and can pick off small creatures.
*   **Thassa, Deep-Dwelling:** A key card for the flicker sub-theme. It allows you to flicker a creature at your end step, re-triggering its ETB.
*   **Primeval Titan:** A massive creature that ramps you by searching for two lands when it enters or attacks.
*   **Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath:** A powerful creature that ramps you, gains you life, and draws you a card.
*   **Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider:** A powerful creature that doubles your counters and can quickly close out a game.

## 3. Planeswalkers
*A suite of powerful planeswalkers to control the board.*
*   **A-Teferi, Time Raveler:** A notoriously powerful planeswalker that shuts down your opponents' instant-speed interaction and can bounce threats.
*   **The Wandering Emperor:** A flash planeswalker that can be a surprise blocker, removal spell, or pump spell.
*   **Liliana of the Veil:** A classic planeswalker that can disrupt your opponents' hands and control the board with her sacrifice ability.
*   **Nissa, Who Shakes the World:** A powerful planeswalker that can untap a forest to generate a large amount of mana and can turn your lands into creatures.
*   **Teferi, Hero of Dominaria:** A powerful control finisher that draws cards, deals with threats, and untaps lands.

## 4. Ramp & Mana Fixing
*Getting to Atraxa's 7 mana cost is crucial.*
*   **Llanowar Elves:** A classic one-mana dork.
*   **Dark Ritual:** A powerful one-shot ritual that can power out an early Atraxa.
*   **Kami of Bamboo Groves:** A flexible creature that can ramp you or find a land.
*   **Utopia Sprawl / Wolfwillow Haven:** Enchantments that ramp you and fix your mana.
*   **Explore / Growth Spiral:** Two-mana spells that ramp you and draw a card.
*   **Arcane Signet / Coldsteel Heart:** Standard two-mana mana rocks.
*   **Key to the Archive:** A powerful mana rock that also lets you discover a powerful spell from its spellbook.
*   **Cultivate / Kodama's Reach:** Classic three-mana ramp spells that find two lands.

## 5. Removal & Board Wipes
*Interaction to deal with your opponents' threats.*
*   **Swords to Plowshares / Fatal Push / Get Lost / Go for the Throat / Cast Down:** A suite of cheap, efficient, single-target removal spells.

*   **Atraxa's Fall:** A cheap removal spell that can deal with a variety of threats.
*   **Leyline Binding:** A cheap, efficient removal spell that can be cast for as little as one mana.

## 6. Counterspells & Protection
*Protecting your commander and your board is key.*
*   **Ephemerate:** A cheap flicker spell that can protect a creature from removal or re-trigger an ETB effect like Atraxa's.
*   **Wash Away:** A flexible counterspell that can be a cheap counter or a powerful answer to a commander.
*   **Mana Tithe:** A surprise counterspell in white that can catch an opponent off guard.
*   **Counterspell / Negate / Disdainful Stroke / Dovin's Veto:** A standard package of counterspells to deal with a variety of threats.
*   **Drown in the Loch:** A flexible spell that can be a counterspell or a removal spell.
*   **Lightning Greaves / Swiftfoot Boots:** Equipment that protects Atraxa and gives her haste.
*   **Emergent Ultimatum:** A powerful spell that can win the game on the spot by letting you cast two of three powerful spells for free.
*   **Time Warp:** A spell that gives you an extra turn, which can be enough to win the game.

## 7. The Mana Base (Lands)
*A complex mana base to support a 4-color deck.*
*   **Fetch Lands, Shock Lands, Triomes, Pathways:** The core of the mana base, providing excellent fixing.
*   **Utility Lands:** Boseiju, Otawara, Takenuma, and Eiganjo provide uncounterable interaction. Command Tower, Mana Confluence, and Reflecting Pool provide perfect mana fixing. Plaza of Heroes protects your commander.
