# Simic Omniscience Deck Guide (Custom Set)

**A Note on the Deck:** This deck uses several cards from a custom set, most notably the key combo piece, "Kona, Rescue Beastie."

## Deck Strategy
**Archetype:** Simic (Blue/Green) Combo
**Format:** Custom Standard

*   **Goal:** The deck's only goal is to resolve its two-card combo: get **Kona, Rescue Beastie** on the battlefield, and then use its ability to put **Omniscience** into play from your hand for free.
*   **How it Plays:** This is a pure combo deck. The first few turns are dedicated to survival and finding your combo pieces. You will use cheap bounce spells and counterspells to stay alive and card draw spells to dig for Kona and Omniscience. Once Omniscience is in play, you can cast your entire hand for free, deploying an army of massive threats to win the game on the spot.

## 1. The Combo
*The two cards that are essential for the deck to function.*
*   **Kona, Rescue Beastie:** The enabler. Its ability to put a permanent from your hand into play for free is the engine that drives the entire deck.
*   **Omniscience:** The payoff. This powerful enchantment allows you to cast spells from your hand without paying their mana costs, enabling you to win the game the turn it comes into play.

## 2. The Payoffs
*The game-winning threats you cast for free once Omniscience is on the battlefield.*
*   **Uthros, Titanic Godcore:** A massive, game-ending threat.
*   **Roiling Dragonstorm:** A spell that likely creates a large number of Dragon tokens.
*   **Marang River Regent:** Likely another large creature that provides significant value.

## 3. Dig & Filtering
*Spells to help you find your combo pieces as quickly as possible.*
*   **Consult the Star Charts / Stock Up:** Card draw spells that help you dig through your library to find Kona and Omniscience.

## 4. Early Game Survival
*Interaction to keep you alive until you can assemble your combo.*
*   **Unauthorized Exit:** A cheap bounce spell to deal with early threats.
*   **Dispelling Exhale:** Likely a cheap counterspell to protect your combo or interact with your opponent.
*   **Lost in the Maze:** A versatile spell that can protect your creatures or tap down an opponent's threat.

## 5. The Mana Base
*A simple two-color mana base designed to be consistent.*
*   **Breeding Pool:** A shock land that can enter untapped.
*   **Willowrush Verge / Evendo, Waking Haven:** Likely dual lands from the custom set.
*   **Cavern of Souls:** Can be used to make Kona uncounterable.

## Sideboard Guide
*The sideboard provides tools to adapt to different matchups.*
*   **Tishana's Tidebinder / Negate / Spell Pierce:** Additional counterspells for control matchups.
*   **Unable to Scream / Hide on the Ceiling:** Likely removal spells for aggressive matchups.
*   **Soul-Guide Lantern:** Graveyard hate for recursive strategies.
*   **Origin of Metalbending:** Likely an artifact-related card for specific matchups.
*   **Vivien Reid:** A versatile planeswalker that can destroy artifacts/enchantments and find creatures.
