# Temur Omniscience Deck Guide (Custom Set)

**A Note on the Deck:** This deck uses several cards from a custom set, most notably the key combo piece, "Kona, Rescue Beastie."

## Deck Strategy
**Archetype:** Temur (Blue/Red/Green) Combo
**Format:** Custom Standard

*   **Goal:** The deck's only goal is to resolve its two-card combo: get **Kona, Rescue Beastie** on the battlefield, and then use its ability to put **Omniscience** into play from your hand for free.
*   **How it Plays:** This is a pure combo deck. The first few turns are dedicated to survival and finding your combo pieces. You will use cheap bounce spells and counterspells to stay alive and card draw spells to dig for Kona and Omniscience. The splash of red in this version gives access to additional powerful threats.

## 1. The Combo
*The two cards that are essential for the deck to function.*
*   **Kona, Rescue Beastie:** The enabler. Its ability to put a permanent from your hand into play for free is the engine that drives the entire deck.
*   **Omniscience:** The payoff. This powerful enchantment allows you to cast spells from your hand without paying their mana costs, enabling you to win the game the turn it comes into play.

## 2. The Payoffs
*The game-winning threats you cast for free once Omniscience is on the battlefield.*
*   **Terror of the Peaks:** The primary reason to splash red. This powerful Dragon deals damage to any target equal to the power of any creature that enters the battlefield under your control. With Omniscience, you can cast a series of large creatures and deal massive amounts of damage directly to your opponent.
*   **Uthros, Titanic Godcore:** A massive, game-ending threat.
*   **Roiling Dragonstorm:** A spell that likely creates a large number of Dragon tokens.
*   **Marang River Regent:** Likely another large creature that provides significant value.

## 3. Dig & Filtering
*Spells to help you find your combo pieces as quickly as possible.*
*   **Consult the Star Charts / Stock Up:** Card draw spells that help you dig through your library to find Kona and Omniscience.

## 4. Early Game Survival
*Interaction to keep you alive until you can assemble your combo.*
*   **Bounce Off:** A cheap bounce spell to deal with early threats.
*   **Dispelling Exhale / Detect Intrusion:** Likely cheap counterspells to protect your combo or interact with your opponent.
*   **Lost in the Maze:** A versatile spell that can protect your creatures or tap down an opponent's threat.

## 5. The Mana Base
*A three-color mana base designed to be consistent.*
*   **Breeding Pool:** A shock land that can enter untapped.
*   **Willowrush Verge / Evendo, Waking Haven:** Likely dual lands from the custom set.
*   **Cavern of Souls:** Can be used to make Kona uncounterable.
