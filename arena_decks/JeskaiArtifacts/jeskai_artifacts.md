# Jeskai Artifacts Deck Guide (Custom Set)

**A Note on the Deck:** This deck appears to be constructed from a custom set of cards. The strategy and card explanations are inferred based on the card names and their likely functions within an artifact-based archetype.

## Deck Strategy
**Archetype:** Jeskai (Blue/Red/White) Artifact Aggro
**Format:** Custom

*   **Goal:** This deck aims to win by creating a massive army of Golem tokens with "Simulacrum Synthesizer." The strategy is to flood the board with cheap artifacts to power up the Golems and then overwhelm the opponent with a wide, powerful board.
*   **How it Plays:** The deck plays a low-to-the-ground aggro game. The early turns are spent deploying cheap artifacts like "Clay-Fired Bricks" and "Spring-Loaded Sawblades." Once "Simulacrum Synthesizer" is in play, every subsequent historic spell (which includes all your artifacts) creates a Golem token that gets progressively larger. The deck uses its interaction to protect its board and push through damage.

## 1. The Engine
*The key card that the entire deck is built around.*
*   **Simulacrum Synthesizer:** This enchantment is the heart of the deck. It creates a Golem token whenever you cast a historic spell, and the power and toughness of that Golem are equal to the number of artifacts you control.

## 2. Cheap Artifacts & Enablers
*These cheap artifacts fuel your "Simulacrum Synthesizer" and enable your aggressive start.*
*   **Clay-Fired Bricks:** A cheap artifact that can be sacrificed to find a basic land, fixing your mana while also counting as an artifact for your synthesizer.
*   **Spring-Loaded Sawblades:** An aggressive artifact creature that can be sacrificed to deal damage to a creature or player.
*   **Authority of the Consuls:** An enchantment that gains you life whenever an opponent's creature enters the battlefield and makes their creatures enter tapped, slowing down their game plan.
*   **The Enigma Jewel:** A powerful artifact that can likely copy your other artifacts, creating even more value.

## 3. Interaction
*Spells to clear the way for your Golem army.*
*   **Perilous Snare:** Likely a cheap removal or tempo spell to deal with opposing threats.

## 4. The Mana Base
*A mana base designed to support a three-color aggressive deck.*
*   **Floodfarm Verge, Repurposing Bay, United Battlefront, Starting Town, Pinnacle Starcage:** These are likely dual lands or utility lands that help fix your mana and may have additional artifact-related abilities.
*   **The Fire Crystal / Cryogen Relic:** Likely mana rocks or artifacts that help cast your spells.
*   **Adagia, Windswept Bastion:** Likely a powerful utility land.
