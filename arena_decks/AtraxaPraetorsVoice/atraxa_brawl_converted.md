# Atraxa, Praetors' Voice Deck Guide: "The Inexorable Engine"

## Commander Strategy

**Atraxa, Praetors' Voice**

*   **Role:** The Engine & The Finisher.
*   **Goal:** Atraxa is the centerpiece of a "Superfriends" and "+1/+1 counters" strategy. Your goal is to control the board with powerful planeswalkers and creatures, and then use Atraxa's **Proliferate** ability at the end of your turn to accumulate overwhelming value.
*   **The Reward:** Every turn, you add another counter to each permanent and player that already has a counter. This means your planeswalkers gain loyalty, your creatures with +1/+1 counters get bigger, and your opponents get closer to being defeated by poison counters. Atraxa's keywords (Flying, Vigilance, Deathtouch, Lifelink) also make her a formidable threat in combat.



## 1. The Superfriends (Planeswalkers)

*This deck runs a suite of powerful planeswalkers that control the board and provide a path to victory. Atraxa's proliferate ability makes them incredibly dangerous.*

*   **Carth the Lion:** A planeswalker support creature. He helps you find more planeswalkers and gives them an extra loyalty counter when they enter.
*   **Narset, Parter of Veils:** A powerful planeswalker that restricts your opponents' card draw while helping you dig for non-creature spells.
*   **Oath of Teferi:** A key enchantment for any Superfriends deck. It allows you to activate the loyalty abilities of your planeswalkers twice each turn.
*   **Tamiyo, Field Researcher:** A versatile planeswalker that can draw you cards, tap down your opponents' permanents, and her ultimate is a game-winning emblem.
*   **Teferi, Hero of Dominaria:** A powerhouse planeswalker. He draws cards, deals with any non-land permanent, and untaps two lands at the end of your turn, allowing you to hold up interaction.
*   **Teferi, Master of Time:** A unique planeswalker that can activate his abilities at instant speed, providing constant card filtering and phasing out threats.
*   **Ugin, the Spirit Dragon:** A colorless planeswalker that acts as a board wipe for colored permanents and can pick off threats with his -X ability.
*   **Vraska, Betrayal's Sting:** A fantastic new addition. She can proliferate, create Phyrexian creature tokens, and her ultimate can win the game on the spot if an opponent is poisoned.
*   **The Wandering Emperor:** A flash planeswalker that can ambush attackers, create samurai tokens, and exile tapped creatures. Her versatility is her greatest strength.



## 2. Proliferate & Counter Synergies

*These are the cards that either have proliferate or synergize with counters to amplify Atraxa's power.*

*   **Astral Cornucopia / Everflowing Chalice:** Mana rocks that enter with counters. You can proliferate their counters to generate huge amounts of mana.
*   **Bloated Contaminator:** A creature with toxic that also proliferates when it deals combat damage to a player. A great way to spread poison and pump your team.
*   **Brokers Ascendancy:** An enchantment that puts a +1/+1 counter on each of your creatures at your end step. A passive way to grow your army.
*   **Contagion Engine:** A powerful artifact that can proliferate twice with a single activation. It can also put a -1/-1 counter on each creature a player controls.
*   **Doubling Season:** A cornerstone of the deck. It doubles the number of counters you place on permanents and doubles the number of tokens you create.
*   **Evolution Sage:** A creature that proliferates every time a land enters the battlefield under your control. Works great with fetch lands and ramp spells.
*   **Flux Channeler:** A creature that proliferates every time you cast a noncreature spell. With a hand full of planeswalkers and spells, this can get out of control quickly.
*   **Ichormoon Gauntlet:** This artifact gives your planeswalkers the ability to proliferate, and if you control 3 or more planeswalkers, you get an extra turn after you take this action.
*   **Inexorable Tide:** An enchantment that proliferates every time you cast a spell. A powerful and resilient engine.
*   **Kami of Whispered Hopes:** This creature boosts your +1/+1 counter generation and can tap for a large amount of mana based on the number of counters on it.
*   **Tekuthal, Inquiry Dominus:** This creature can become indestructible and will double all of your proliferate triggers.
*   **Tezzeret's Gambit:** A spell that draws you two cards and then proliferates. A great way to refuel and advance your board state.
*   **Thrummingbird:** A small, evasive creature that proliferates every time it deals combat damage to a player.
*   **Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider:** A creature that doubles the counters you place on permanents while halving the counters your opponents place. It's a one-sided Doubling Season on a stick.



## 3. Infect & Toxic (Alternate Win-Condition)

*While the main goal is to win with planeswalkers, this deck has a strong poison sub-theme that can win the game on its own.*

*   **Cankerbloom:** A versatile creature that can destroy an artifact or enchantment or proliferate.
*   **Ezuri, Stalker of Spheres:** Draws a card whenever another creature with +1/+1 counters enters the battlefield, and can be used to proliferate.
*   **Infectious Inquiry:** A spell that draws you cards, loses you life, and gives each opponent a poison counter to start the clock.
*   **Ixhel, Scion of Atraxa:** A toxic creature that gives you a powerful card advantage engine once your opponents are corrupted (have 3 or more poison counters).
*   **Phyresis Outbreak:** A board wipe that gives creatures -1/-1 counters and also gives each opponent a poison counter.
*   **Prologue to Phyresis:** A cheap cantrip that gives each opponent a poison counter. A great way to enable your other poison-related cards.
*   **Skithiryx, the Blight Dragon:** A hasty, flying dragon with infect. It can end the game in just a few hits.
*   **Skrelv, Defector Mite:** A tiny toxic creature that can protect your other creatures by giving them hexproof from a color, making them effectively unblockable.
*   **Venerated Rotpriest:** A key card for the toxic strategy. It gives your opponents poison counters whenever your creatures are targeted by their spells.
*   **Vraska's Fall:** A removal spell that forces an opponent to sacrifice a creature or planeswalker and also proliferates.
*   **Fynn, the Fangbearer:** Gives your deathtouch creatures the ability to apply poison counters, which works well with Atraxa.



## 4. Ramp & Mana Fixing

*This is a 4-color deck, so a strong ramp and fixing package is essential.*

*   **Arcane Signet / Fellwar Stone / Mind Stone:** A suite of 2-mana rocks that provide excellent mana fixing and ramp.
*   **Birds of Paradise / Bloom Tender / Delighted Halfling:** A trio of powerful one and two-mana dorks that can produce any color of mana you need.
*   **Chromatic Lantern:** A 3-mana artifact that makes all of your lands tap for any color of mana, completely solving any color-fixing issues.
*   **Farseek / Growth Spiral / Three Visits:** A package of cheap ramp spells that help you get ahead on mana and find the lands you need.



## 5. Card Draw & Tutors

*These cards help you find the answers you need and keep your hand full of gas.*

*   **Demonic Tutor / Enlightened Tutor / Profane Tutor:** A powerful tutor package that lets you find any card, an artifact/enchantment, or any card with a delay.
*   **Esper Sentinel:** An aggressive one-drop that can draw you a surprising number of cards over the course of a game.
*   **Rhystic Study:** A classic enchantment that either draws you a card or taxes your opponents for casting spells.
*   **Smothering Tithe:** While not direct card draw, this enchantment provides a massive amount of mana ramp by creating treasure tokens, which can feel just as good.



## 6. Removal & Interaction

*This deck has a versatile suite of removal and interaction to deal with any threat.*

*   **Counterspell / Dovin's Veto / Syncopate:** A flexible counterspell package that can deal with a variety of threats.
*   **Cyclonic Rift:** A powerful bounce spell that can be overloaded to create a one-sided board wipe, clearing the way for a lethal attack.
*   **Farewell:** The ultimate board wipe. It can exile artifacts, creatures, enchantments, and graveyards, dealing with any permanent-based threat.
*   **Path to Exile / Swords to Plowshares:** The two best one-mana removal spells in the game. They exile a creature for a single white mana.
*   **Archon of Absolution:** A creature that taxes your opponents for attacking you, providing a pillow-fort effect.
*   **Settle the Wreckage:** An instant-speed board wipe that can be a surprise for an opponent who is attacking with a large army.



## 7. The Mana Base (Lands)

*The mana base is built to consistently provide all four colors of mana.*

*   **Fetch Lands (e.g., Flooded Strand, Polluted Delta):** These lands let you search your library for a land with a basic land type (like a Shock Land or Triome) and put it onto the battlefield. They are essential for mana fixing.
*   **Shock Lands (e.g., Breeding Pool, Hallowed Fountain):** These lands can enter the battlefield untapped if you pay 2 life. They have two basic land types, so they can be found with fetch lands.
*   **Triomes (e.g., Indatha Triome, Zagoth Triome):** These lands enter the battlefield tapped but can be cycled for a card if you don't need the mana. They have three basic land types, making them great targets for fetch lands.
*   **Pathways (e.g., Branchloft Pathway, Clearwater Pathway):** Modal double-faced lands that give you a choice between two colors of mana.
*   **Utility Lands (e.g., Karn's Bastion, Command Tower):** These lands provide additional value beyond just mana.
