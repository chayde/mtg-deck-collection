# Karametra Deck Guide: "Heavenly Host" (Budget)

## Deck Strategy
**Archetype:** Selesnya (Green/White) Angels & Landfall
**Focus:** Ramp, Angel Tribal, Board Control

*   **Goal:** This deck aims to win by assembling a powerful army of Angels. It uses its commander, **Karametra, God of Harvests**, as a powerful ramp engine to cast expensive, high-impact Angel creatures far ahead of the curve.
*   **How it Plays:** The early game is dedicated to ramping and casting small creatures to trigger Karametra's ability. This thins the deck of lands and ensures you never miss a land drop. Once you have a significant mana advantage, you'll start deploying your powerful Angel threats, which control the board and present a formidable flying army that is difficult for opponents to deal with.

## 1. The Commander
*   **Karametra, God of Harvests:** The heart of the deck's ramp engine. Every time you cast a creature spell, she lets you search your library for a Forest or Plains and put it directly onto the battlefield, providing a massive and consistent mana advantage.

## 2. The Angelic Army
*The powerful flying threats that will win you the game.*
*   **Avacyn, Angel of Hope:** The ultimate protector. She makes all of your other permanents indestructible, making your board incredibly resilient to removal.
*   **Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite:** A "Sliver Killer." She gives all of your creatures +2/+2 while giving all of your opponents' creatures -2/-2, often wiping out their entire board of small creatures.
*   **Giada, Font of Hope:** An essential two-drop that ramps you and makes every subsequent Angel you play even larger.
*   **Lyra Dawnbringer / Righteous Valkyrie:** Powerful "lords" that give all of your other Angels a power/toughness boost and lifelink.
*   **Linvala, Keeper of Silence:** Shuts down the activated abilities of your opponents' creatures.
*   **Archangel of Tithes:** A powerful taxing effect that makes it difficult for your opponents to attack you or block your creatures.

## 3. Landfall & Ramp
*A powerful package of ramp and landfall synergies to accelerate your game plan.*
*   **Avenger of Zendikar / Scute Swarm:** Creatures that create a massive army of tokens based on the number of lands you have in play.
*   **Lotus Cobra / Tireless Provisioner:** Creatures that generate mana or treasure tokens whenever a land enters the battlefield.
*   **Birds of Paradise / Avacyn's Pilgrim:** One-mana dorks that provide early mana acceleration.
*   **Zendikar Resurgent / Mirari's Wake:** Powerful enchantments that double your mana and provide card draw.

## 4. Interaction & Protection
*Spells to protect your board and interact with your opponents.*
*   **Swords to Plowshares / Path to Exile / Beast Within:** A suite of the most efficient single-target removal spells in the format.
*   **Farewell / Austere Command:** Powerful and flexible board wipes.
*   **Heroic Intervention / Akroma's Will:** Instants that can protect your entire board from removal or act as a powerful combat trick to win the game.
*   **Tutors (Eladamri's Call, Worldly Tutor):** Spells to search your library for the exact creature you need.
