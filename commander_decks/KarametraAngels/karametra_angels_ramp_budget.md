# Karametra Deck Guide: "The Heavenly Host"

## Commander Strategy
**Karametra, God of Harvests**
*   **Archetype:** Selesnya (Green/White) Angels & Landfall
*   **Goal:** This deck aims to win by assembling a powerful army of Angels. It uses its commander, Karametra, as a powerful ramp engine to cast expensive, high-impact Angel creatures far ahead of the curve.
*   **How it Plays:** The early game is dedicated to ramping and casting small creatures to trigger Karametra's ability. This thins the deck of lands and ensures you never miss a land drop. Once you have a significant mana advantage, you'll start deploying your powerful Angel threats, which control the board and present a formidable flying army.

## 1. The Commander: God of Harvests
*   **Karametra, God of Harvests:** The heart of the deck's ramp engine. Every time you cast a creature spell, she lets you search your library for a Forest or Plains and put it directly onto the battlefield, providing a massive and consistent mana advantage. She is also an indestructible 6/7 creature once your devotion to green and white is high enough.

## 2. The Angelic Army: Lords & Finishers
*The powerful flying threats that will win you the game. Many also provide buffs to your other angels.*
*   **Avacyn, Angel of Hope:** The ultimate protector. She makes all of your other permanents indestructible.
*   **Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite:** A "Sliver Killer." She gives all of your creatures +2/+2 while giving all of your opponents' creatures -2/-2, often wiping out their entire board.
*   **Lyra Dawnbringer / Righteous Valkyrie / Herald of War:** Powerful "lords" that give all of your other Angels a power/toughness boost and other keywords like lifelink.
*   **Giada, Font of Hope:** An essential two-drop that taps for mana for Angels and makes every subsequent Angel you play even larger.
*   **Resplendent Angel / Bishop of Wings:** Create more angel tokens, helping you go wide.
*   **Battle Angels of Tyr / Angel of Serenity / Sunblast Angel:** Angels that provide powerful control effects when they enter the battlefield or attack.
*   **Serra's Emissary:** Choose a card type (like "creature") to give yourself protection from.

## 3. Hatebears & Control
*Creatures and enchantments that slow down your opponents and disrupt their strategies.*
*   **Linvala, Keeper of Silence:** Shuts down the activated abilities of your opponents' creatures.
*   **Archangel of Tithes / Angelic Arbiter:** Powerful taxing effects that make it difficult for your opponents to attack you or cast spells.
*   **Authority of the Consuls:** A one-mana enchantment that makes your opponents' creatures enter tapped and gains you life.
*   **Aura Shards:** Destroys an artifact or enchantment whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control. A must-answer threat for many decks.

## 4. Landfall & Ramp Engine
*A powerful package of ramp and landfall synergies to accelerate your game plan and take advantage of Karametra's triggers.*
*   **Avenger of Zendikar / Scute Swarm:** Creatures that create a massive army of tokens based on the number of lands you have in play.
*   **Lotus Cobra / Tireless Provisioner:** Creatures that generate mana or treasure/food tokens whenever a land enters the battlefield.
*   **Birds of Paradise / Avacyn's Pilgrim:** One-mana dorks that provide early mana acceleration.
*   **Zendikar Resurgent / Mirari's Wake:** Powerful enchantments that double your mana and provide other benefits.
*   **Cultivate / Kodama's Reach / Farseek / Rampant Growth / Nature's Lore / Three Visits:** A suite of classic green ramp spells to find basic lands.
*   **Starnheim Aspirant:** Reduces the cost of your Angel spells.

## 5. Card Draw & Value
*   **Guardian Project / Tocasia's Welcome / Tribute to the World Tree:** Enchantments that draw you a card whenever a creature enters the battlefield.
*   **Harmonize:** A simple spell to draw three cards.
*   **Eternal Witness / Bala Ged Recovery:** Ways to get key cards back from your graveyard.
*   **Luminarch Aspirant:** A cheap creature that grows one of your threats each turn.

## 6. Interaction & Protection
*Spells to protect your board and interact with your opponents.*
*   **Swords to Plowshares / Path to Exile / Beast Within / Generous Gift:** A suite of the most efficient single-target removal spells in the format.
*   **Farewell / Austere Command:** Powerful and flexible board wipes that can be customized to save your key permanents.
*   **Heroic Intervention / Akroma's Will:** Instants that can protect your entire board from removal or act as a powerful combat trick to win the game.
*   **Swiftfoot Boots / Lightning Greaves:** Equipment to protect your most important creature.
*   **Tutors (Eladamri's Call, Worldly Tutor):** Spells to search your library for the exact creature you need.

## 7. The Mana Base
*A straightforward Selesnya mana base with some powerful utility lands.*
*   **Utility Lands:** Ghost Quarter for land destruction, Mosswort Bridge to cheat a creature into play, Reliquary Tower to have no maximum hand size, and Gavony Township to buff your team.
*   **Dual Lands:** A mix of fetch lands, shock lands, bond lands, and check lands to ensure you always have both of your colors.
