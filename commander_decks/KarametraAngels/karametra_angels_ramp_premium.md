# Karametra Deck Guide: "The Heavenly Host (Premium)"

## Commander Strategy
**Karametra, God of Harvests**
*   **Archetype:** Selesnya (Green/White) Angels & Landfall
*   **Goal:** This is the uncompromised version of the Karametra Angels deck. It aims to win by assembling a powerful army of Angels as quickly and consistently as possible, using the most efficient ramp, tutors, and threats available.
*   **How it Plays:** The deck uses Karametra as a powerful ramp engine to cast expensive, high-impact Angel creatures far ahead of the curve. This version includes premium card advantage engines and powerful protection, making it more resilient and explosive than its budget counterpart.

## 1. The Commander: God of Harvests
*   **Karametra, God of Harvests:** The heart of the deck's ramp engine. Every time you cast a creature spell, she lets you search your library for a Forest or Plains and put it directly onto the battlefield.

## 2. The Angelic Army: Lords & Finishers
*The most powerful Angels in the game.*
*   **Avacyn, Angel of Hope:** The ultimate protector. She makes all of your other permanents indestructible.
*   **Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite:** A "Sliver Killer." She gives all of your creatures +2/+2 while giving all of your opponents' creatures -2/-2.
*   **Archangel of Thune:** A powerful threat that grows your entire team whenever you gain life. Works incredibly well with the deck's incidental lifegain.
*   **Lyra Dawnbringer / Righteous Valkyrie:** Powerful "lords" that give all of your other Angels a power/toughness boost and lifelink.
*   **Giada, Font of Hope:** An essential two-drop that ramps you and makes every subsequent Angel you play even larger.

## 3. Hatebears & Control
*Creatures and enchantments that slow down your opponents and disrupt their strategies.*
*   **Linvala, Keeper of Silence:** Shuts down the activated abilities of your opponents' creatures.
*   **Archangel of Tithes / Angelic Arbiter:** Powerful taxing effects that make it difficult for your opponents to attack you or cast spells.
*   **Authority of the Consuls:** A one-mana enchantment that makes your opponents' creatures enter tapped and gains you life.
*   **Aura Shards:** Destroys an artifact or enchantment whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control.

## 4. Landfall & Ramp Engine (Premium)
*A premium package of ramp and landfall synergies.*
*   **The Great Henge:** An incredibly powerful artifact that provides ramp, card draw, lifegain, and a power boost to your creatures. Often costs very little to cast.
*   **Smothering Tithe:** A powerful enchantment that generates a massive amount of treasure tokens, giving you a huge mana advantage.
*   **Mirari's Wake:** A powerful enchantment that doubles your mana and gives all of your creatures +1/+1.
*   **Avenger of Zendikar / Scute Swarm:** Creatures that create a massive army of tokens based on the number of lands you have in play.
*   **Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx:** A land that can produce an enormous amount of mana in a mono-colored or two-colored deck with high devotion.

## 5. Card Draw & Value (Premium)
*The most efficient spells for finding your threats and keeping your hand full.*
*   **Sylvan Library:** A powerful enchantment that lets you draw two extra cards each turn, at the cost of life.
*   **Esper Sentinel:** A premium one-drop creature that can draw you a huge number of cards by taxing your opponents' non-creature spells.
*   **Guardian Project / Tribute to the World Tree:** Enchantments that draw you a card whenever a creature enters the battlefield.
*   **Worldly Tutor / Eladamri's Call:** Efficient tutors to find the exact creature you need at a moment's notice.

## 6. Interaction & Protection (Premium)
*The best spells available for protecting your board and interacting with your opponents.*
*   **Teferi's Protection:** The ultimate protection spell, phasing out all of your permanents until your next turn, saving you from board wipes and targeted removal.
*   **Farewell / Austere Command:** Powerful and flexible board wipes that can be customized to save your key permanents.
*   **Swords to Plowshares / Path to Exile / Beast Within:** A suite of the most efficient single-target removal spells.
*   **Boseiju, Who Endures:** An uncounterable removal spell on a land.

## 7. The Mana Base (Premium)
*A premium mana base with fetch lands, shock lands, and powerful utility lands ensures perfect mana every game.*
*   **Fetch Lands (e.g., Windswept Heath):** Allows you to find your key dual lands like Temple Garden or Canopy Vista.
*   **Dual Lands (e.g., Temple Garden, Bountiful Promenade, Canopy Vista):** The best available lands that tap for both of your colors.
*   **Utility Lands:** Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx, Boseiju, Who Endures, Yavimaya, Cradle of Growth, Gavony Township.
