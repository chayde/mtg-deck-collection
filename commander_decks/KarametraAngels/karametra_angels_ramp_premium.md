# Karametra Deck Guide: "Heavenly Host" (Premium)

## Deck Strategy
**Archetype:** Selesnya (Green/White) Angels & Landfall
**Focus:** Ramp, Angel Tribal, Board Control

*   **Goal:** This is the uncompromised version of the Karametra Angels deck. It aims to win by assembling a powerful army of Angels as quickly and consistently as possible, using the most efficient ramp, tutors, and threats available.
*   **How it Plays:** The deck uses **Karametra, God of Harvests**, as a powerful ramp engine to cast expensive, high-impact Angel creatures far ahead of the curve. This version includes premium card advantage engines like **Sylvan Library** and **The Great Henge**, and powerful protection like **Teferi's Protection**, making it more resilient and explosive than its budget counterpart.

## 1. The Commander
*   **Karametra, God of Harvests:** The heart of the deck's ramp engine. Every time you cast a creature spell, she lets you search your library for a Forest or Plains and put it directly onto the battlefield.

## 2. The Angelic Army
*The most powerful Angels in the game.*
*   **Avacyn, Angel of Hope:** The ultimate protector. She makes all of your other permanents indestructible.
*   **Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite:** A "Sliver Killer." She gives all of your creatures +2/+2 while giving all of your opponents' creatures -2/-2.
*   **Archangel of Thune:** A powerful threat that grows your entire team whenever you gain life.
*   **Giada, Font of Hope:** An essential two-drop that ramps you and makes every subsequent Angel you play even larger.
*   **Lyra Dawnbringer / Righteous Valkyrie:** Powerful "lords" that give all of your other Angels a power/toughness boost and lifelink.

## 3. Landfall & Ramp Engine
*A premium package of ramp and landfall synergies.*
*   **The Great Henge:** An incredibly powerful artifact that provides ramp, card draw, lifegain, and a power boost to your creatures.
*   **Smothering Tithe:** A powerful enchantment that generates a massive amount of treasure tokens, giving you a huge mana advantage.
*   **Mirari's Wake:** A powerful enchantment that doubles your mana and gives all of your creatures +1/+1.
*   **Avenger of Zendikar / Scute Swarm:** Creatures that create a massive army of tokens based on the number of lands you have in play.

## 4. Card Advantage & Tutors
*The most efficient spells for finding your threats and keeping your hand full.*
*   **Sylvan Library:** A powerful enchantment that lets you draw two extra cards each turn.
*   **Esper Sentinel:** A premium one-drop creature that can draw you a huge number of cards.
*   **Worldly Tutor / Eladamri's Call:** Efficient tutors to find the exact creature you need.

## 5. Interaction & Protection
*The best spells available for protecting your board and interacting with your opponents.*
*   **Teferi's Protection:** The ultimate protection spell, phasing out all of your permanents until your next turn.
*   **Swords to Plowshares / Path to Exile / Beast Within:** A suite of the most efficient single-target removal spells in the format.
*   **Farewell / Austere Command:** Powerful and flexible board wipes.
