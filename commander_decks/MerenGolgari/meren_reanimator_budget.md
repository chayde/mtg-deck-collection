# Meren Deck Guide: "The Grave Tender"

## Commander Strategy
**Meren of Clan Nel Toth**
*   **Role:** The Engine.
*   **Goal:** Generate "Experience Counters" whenever one of your creatures dies.
*   **The Reward:** At the beginning of your end step, you can reanimate a creature from your graveyard with a mana value less than or equal to your number of experience counters. This provides incredible, repeatable value.

## 1. The Early Game (Ramp & Self-Mill)
*Get Meren out early and fill the graveyard with tools for her to reanimate later.*
*   **Sakura-Tribe Elder:** The gold standard. Sacrifices itself to find a land, giving you ramp and an immediate experience counter.
*   **Wood Elves / Farhaven Elf:** Ramp on a body. When they enter, they search for a land.
*   **Solemn Simulacrum:** The "Sad Robot" is pure value. Ramps when he enters, draws a card when he dies.
*   **Stitcher's Supplier:** The best graveyard filler. Mills 3 cards when it enters and another 3 when it dies.
*   **Satyr Wayfinder:** Mills you and finds a land.
*   **Grisly Salvage:** Instant-speed mill that also tutors a creature or land to your hand.
*   **Elves of Deep Shadow / Llanowar Elves / Elvish Mystic / Fyndhorn Elves:** Classic one-mana dorks to accelerate into Meren.

## 2. Board Control (The Toolbox)
*These are creatures that solve problems when they enter or die. Meren can recur these repeatedly to control the entire board.*
*   **Fleshbag Marauder / Merciless Executioner / Plaguecrafter / Demon's Disciple:** "Edict" effects. Each player sacrifices a creature. This gets around indestructible and hexproof. Plaguecrafter also hits planeswalkers.
*   **Ravenous Chupacabra / Shriekmaw:** Targeted creature removal on a stick.
*   **Caustic Caterpillar / Foundation Breaker / Reclamation Sage:** Your answers to problematic artifacts and enchantments.
*   **Haywire Mite:** The best version of this effect. Exiles the target, which stops death triggers, and you gain life.
*   **Spore Frog:** A reusable "Fog" effect. Sacrifice it to prevent all combat damage for a turn. Meren can bring it back every turn to lock down combat-focused decks.
*   **Mikaeus, the Unhallowed:** Gives all your non-Human creatures "Undying," meaning they come back after dying. This doubles all your death triggers and protects your board.

## 3. The Value Engine (Draw & Consistency)
*Keep the cards flowing and find the exact pieces you need.*
*   **Grim Haruspex / Midnight Reaper / Morbid Opportunist:** Draw a card whenever a creature dies. The backbone of your card advantage.
*   **Braids, Arisen Nightmare:** A sacrifice outlet that either draws you cards or makes opponents sacrifice their own permanents.
*   **Disciple of Bolas:** Sacrifice a large creature to draw a huge number of cards and gain a bunch of life.
*   **Sidisi, Undead Vizier:** "Exploit" a creature on ETB to Demonic Tutor for any card in your deck.
*   **Gravebreaker Lamia:** "Entomb" on a stick. Tutors a card from your library directly into your graveyard.
*   **Skullclamp:** The most powerful card draw engine for this strategy. Equip to a 1-toughness creature and it dies, drawing you two cards.
*   **Birthing Pod:** The ultimate value ladder. Sacrifice a creature to find another one with a higher mana cost.
*   **Buried Alive / Jarad's Orders:** Tutors creatures directly into the graveyard, setting up your reanimation targets.
*   **Eternal Witness / Timeless Witness:** Brings back any card from your graveyard to your hand.

## 4. Win Conditions (The Finishers)
*Once you've controlled the game, close it out with these powerful threats.*
*   **Gray Merchant of Asphodel (Gary):** Drains each opponent for a massive amount of life based on your devotion to black. Reanimating him multiple times will win the game.
*   **Syr Konrad, the Grim:** Deals damage to opponents whenever creatures leave the graveyard or die. A passive damage source that adds up quickly.
*   **Kokusho, the Evening Star:** When it dies, each opponent loses 5 life and you gain that much life. A huge life swing.
*   **Sheoldred, Whispering One:** A reanimator and an edict engine in one. Brings back your best creature each turn while forcing opponents to sacrifice theirs.
*   **Avenger of Zendikar:** Creates an army of plant tokens that get huge as you play more lands.
*   **Izoni, Thousand-Eyed:** Creates an army of insect tokens based on your graveyard size, and can sacrifice them to draw cards.
*   **Hornet Queen:** Creates an army of flying deathtouch insects, which can dominate the board on offense and defense.

## 5. Sacrifice Outlets & Spells
*You need free and easy ways to kill your own creatures to get experience counters and death triggers.*
*   **Viscera Seer / Carrion Feeder:** Free, instant-speed sacrifice outlets that let you control when your creatures die.
*   **Maelstrom Pulse / Beast Within / Tear Asunder / Putrefy:** Versatile removal spells to handle any nonland threat.
*   **Victimize / Dread Return / Living Death:** Powerful reanimation spells that can bring back multiple threats at once.
*   **Village Rites / Corrupted Conviction / Deadly Dispute:** Instant-speed card draw that requires sacrificing a creature.

## 6. The Mana Base (37 Total)
*   **Utility Lands:** High Market and Grim Backwoods provide more sacrifice outlets. Bojuka Bog is graveyard hate. Command Tower and others provide color fixing.
*   **Basics:** 14 Swamp, 13 Forest.

## Upgrades: Bracket 3 Tuned (<$50/card)
*These cards increase consistency and interaction without breaking into "cEDH" territory.*
*   **Assassin's Trophy:** Replaces Putrefy. Instant speed removal for any permanent.
*   **Toxic Deluge:** Replaces Beast Within. The best board wipe in black; gets around Indestructible.
*   **Yawgmoth, Thran Physician:** Replaces Grim Haruspex. A sacrifice outlet, draw engine, and removal all in one.
*   **Reanimate:** Replaces Dread Return. The most efficient reanimation spell ever printed.
*   **Agadeem's Awakening:** Replaces a Swamp. A land that doubles as a mass-reanimation spell.
*   **Rise of the Dark Realms:** Replaces Izoni, Thousand-Eyed. The ultimate finisher; reanimates all graveyards.
*   **Altar of Dementia:** Replaces Viscera Seer. A free sacrifice outlet that also mills you to fuel your graveyard.
*   **Pattern of Rebirth:** Replaces Jarad's Orders. Enchant a creature, sacrifice it, and tutor any creature from your deck onto the battlefield.
*   **Pitiless Plunderer:** Replaces Satyr Wayfinder. Generates treasure on every death, providing massive mana.
*   **Boseiju, Who Endures:** Replaces a Forest. Uncounterable removal that is also a land.
*   **Takenuma, Abandoned Mire:** Replaces a Swamp. A land that can mill you and return a creature to your hand.
*   **Ophiomancer:** Replaces Carrion Feeder. Creates a deathtouch snake every upkeep, providing infinite fodder.
