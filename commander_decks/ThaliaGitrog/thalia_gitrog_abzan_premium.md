# Thalia and Gitrog Deck Guide: "Land, Tax, and Sacrifice (Premium)"

## Commander Strategy
**Thalia and The Gitrog Monster**
*   **Role:** A value, control, and combat powerhouse all in one.
*   **Abilities:** First Strike and Deathtouch make it a terrifying attacker and blocker. It forces opponents' creatures and non-basic lands to enter tapped. It lets you play an extra land on your turn. When you play a land, you can sacrifice a creature or land to draw a card.
*   **Goal:** Control the board with "stax" and "hatebear" effects while generating massive value through landfall and graveyard synergies, ultimately winning through combat or draining opponents.

## 1. The Core Engine: Lands Matter
*These cards allow you to maximize the "play an extra land" and "draw a card when a land hits the graveyard" abilities of your commander. This section is largely the same as the budget version, as the core engine is already very efficient.*
*   **Ramunap Excavator / Crucible of Worlds:** Allow you to play lands from your graveyard.
*   **Azusa, Lost but Seeking:** Lets you play two additional lands on your turn.
*   **The Gitrog Monster:** The original! Gives you an additional land drop and lets you draw a card whenever a land is put into your graveyard.
*   **Ancient Greenwarden:** Doubles all your landfall triggers and lets you play lands from your graveyard.
*   **Tireless Provisioner / Lotus Cobra:** Generate mana (as Treasure/Food) or a burst of mana whenever a land enters the battlefield.

## 2. Landfall Payoffs: Winning the Game
*These cards turn your land plays into a dominant board state and a direct path to victory.*
*   **Scute Swarm:** Creates an exponentially growing army of insect tokens with every land drop.
*   **Avenger of Zendikar:** Creates an army of plant tokens that get permanently buffed every time you play a land.
*   **Ob Nixilis, the Fallen:** Drains an opponent for 3 life every time a land enters the battlefield under your control.
*   **Felidar Retreat:** Either creates a 2/2 cat token or puts a +1/+1 counter on your whole team with each land drop.
*   **Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite:** A massive "anthem" for your creatures while shrinking your opponents' creatures.

## 3. "Hatebears" & Control: Slowing Down Opponents
*Small, disruptive creatures and enchantments that slow down your opponents and interfere with their game plans.*
*   **Drana and Linvala:** Shuts off all activated abilities of your opponents' creatures.
*   **Opposition Agent:** Steals your opponents' tutors, letting you search their library for a card instead.
*   **Dauthi Voidwalker:** Exiles any card that would go to an opponent's graveyard and lets you cast one of them for free.
*   **Authority of the Consuls / Blind Obedience:** Forces opponents' creatures to enter tapped and gains you life.
*   **Collector Ouphe / Manglehorn:** Shuts off artifact abilities or forces them to enter tapped.

## 4. Premium Removal & Tutors
*This version includes the most efficient and powerful tutors and removal available.*
*   **Vampiric Tutor:** The best tutor. At instant speed, search your library for any card and put it on top.
*   **Toxic Deluge / Damn:** The best black board wipes.
*   **Swords to Plowshares / Path to Exile:** The most efficient single-target creature removal.
*   **Assassin's Trophy / Anguished Unmaking:** Flexible, instant-speed removal that can hit almost any permanent.
*   **Boseiju, Who Endures:** A premium upgrade. It's a land that doubles as an uncounterable removal spell for an artifact, enchantment, or nonbasic land.

## 5. Premium Value & Card Draw
*This is where the premium budget makes the biggest difference, providing unmatched card advantage and value.*
*   **Sheoldred, the Apocalypse:** A powerhouse. Draws you an extra card and gains you 2 life whenever you draw, and makes opponents lose 2 life on their draws. A must-answer threat.
*   **The Great Henge:** One of the best value engines ever printed. It provides mana, life gain, +1/+1 counters, and draws a card for every creature you play.
*   **Esper Sentinel:** The premier white card draw engine. It "taxes" your opponents for playing their first noncreature spell each turn, drawing you a massive number of cards over the course of a game.
*   **Toski, Bearer of Secrets:** An indestructible creature that draws you a card whenever one of your creatures deals combat damage to a player.

## 6. Ramp & Mana Fixing
*   **Sol Ring / Arcane Signet / Talismans:** Standard artifact ramp to accelerate your game plan.
*   **Birds of Paradise / Deathrite Shaman / Elves of Deep Shadow / Avacyn's Pilgrim:** One-mana dorks that produce all the colors you need.
*   **Three Visits / Nature's Lore / Farseek:** Two-mana ramp spells that search for lands and put them directly into play.
*   **Smothering Tithe:** A powerhouse enchantment that generates a massive amount of treasure tokens.

## 7. The Mana Base: Utility & Fetches
*The mana base is critical, filled with lands that are also spells.*
*   **Fetch Lands (Verdant Catacombs, Windswept Heath, Marsh Flats):** The core of the mana base. They find your shock lands or triomes and trigger landfall twice.
*   **Utility Lands (Boseiju, Bojuka Bog):** Provide uncounterable removal and graveyard hate.
*   **"Fixer" Lands (Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth / Yavimaya, Cradle of Growth):** Make all your lands into Swamps or Forests, ensuring perfect mana.
*   **Shock Lands & Triomes:** The best dual/tri-color lands in the game.
