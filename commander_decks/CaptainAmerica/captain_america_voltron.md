# Captain America Voltron Deck Guide

**A Note on the Commander:** "Captain America, First Avenger" is a custom commander. Based on the deck's description, its abilities likely involve cheating equipment into play, attaching it for free upon attacking, and "throwing" (unattaching) it to deal damage.

## Deck Strategy
**Archetype:** Jeskai (Blue/Red/White) Equipment Voltron
**Focus:** Equipment, "Fling" Damage, Cost Reduction

*   **Goal:** The deck's primary goal is to win by "suiting up" Captain America with powerful equipment and dealing 21 commander damage. A secondary win condition is to use his inferred "throw" ability to deal direct damage to opponents based on the mana cost of the equipment.
*   **How it Plays:** The deck spends the early game ramping and casting cheap support creatures that reduce the cost of equipment or draw cards when you cast them. The mid-game is focused on casting Captain America and starting to attach equipment for free when he attacks. The deck uses a "Sunforger" package of instants to provide interaction and protection.

## 1. The "Throwing" Arsenal (Equipment)
*High-impact equipment to attach to Captain America.*
*   **Argentum Armor:** Destroys a permanent when the equipped creature attacks.
*   **Colossus Hammer:** Provides a massive +10/+10 boost.
*   **Excalibur, Sword of Eden:** A custom card with a very high mana value, likely dealing huge damage when "thrown."
*   **Sunforger:** A key piece that acts as a repeatable tutor for your red and white instants.
*   **Hammer of Nazahn:** Makes your commander indestructible and auto-equips itself.
*   **Protection (Swiftfoot Boots, Lightning Greaves, Mithril Coat, Robe of Stars):** A package of equipment to give Captain America hexproof, shroud, or indestructible to protect him from removal.

## 2. The Support Squad
*Creatures and spells that find your equipment, reduce their cost, or draw you cards.*
*   **Tutors (Stonehewer Giant, Trophy Mage, Tribute Mage, Open the Armory):** A suite of creatures and spells to search your library for the exact equipment you need.
*   **Cost Reducers (Danitha Capashen, Etherium Sculptor, Foundry Inspector):** Creatures that make your artifacts and equipment cheaper to cast.
*   **Card Draw (Akiri, Fearless Voyager, Sram, Senior Edificer, Puresteel Paladin):** Creatures that draw you cards whenever you cast equipment or attack with an equipped creature.
*   **Free Equips (Ardenn, Intrepid Archaeologist, Bruenor Battlehammer):** Creatures that let you move your equipment around for free.

## 3. The "Sunforger" Package
*A toolbox of powerful red and white instants that can be tutored and cast with Sunforger.*
*   **Removal (Swords to Plowshares, Path to Exile, Generous Gift, Chaos Warp):** A versatile suite of instant-speed removal.
*   **Protection (Boros Charm, Deflecting Palm, Sejiri Shelter):** Spells to protect your commander or redirect damage.
*   **Counters (Dovin's Veto):** An uncounterable counterspell to protect your game plan.
*   **Utility (Wear // Tear):** A flexible spell to destroy an artifact or enchantment.

## 4. Interaction & Utility
*Other spells to round out the deck.*
*   **Board Wipes (Blasphemous Act, Austere Command):** To reset the board when you fall behind.
*   **Card Selection (Brainstorm, Ponder, Preordain):** Cheap cantrips to smooth out your draws.
*   **Damage Multiplier (Kediss, Emberclaw Familiar):** Allows you to deal damage to all of your opponents when your commander hits one of them.

## Upgrades: High-Power Additions
*These are powerful cards that can be added to increase the deck's power level.*
*   **Stoneforge Mystic:** The best equipment tutor in the game.
*   **Esper Sentinel:** A premium source of card draw.
*   **The Reaver Cleaver:** Generates a massive amount of treasure tokens.
*   **Cyclonic Rift:** A one-sided board wipe that often wins the game on the spot.
*   **Commander's Plate:** Provides a huge stat boost and protection.
*   **Helm of the Host:** Creates copies of your commander.
*   **Godo, Bandit Warlord:** Can tutor for Helm of the Host and provides extra combat steps.
