# Sliver Deck Guide: "The Hive"

## Commander Strategy
**The First Sliver**
*   **Role:** The Value Engine.
*   **Goal:** To cast Slivers from your hand.
*   **The Reward:** Every Sliver spell you cast gains **Cascade**, which means you reveal cards from the top of your library until you hit a nonland card that costs less, and you cast that spell for free. This allows you to build a massive board presence out of nowhere. The deck's primary commander is The First Sliver, but it can be swapped with other 5-color slivers.

## 1. The Commanders: Leaders of the Hive
*These are the legendary 5-color slivers that can lead the swarm. This deck is built to easily swap between them depending on the game plan.*
*   **The First Sliver:** The primary commander. Provides Cascade to all your sliver spells, generating immense value.
*   **Sliver Overlord:** The toolbox commander. Acts as a tutor, allowing you to pay 3 mana to search your library for any sliver card.
*   **Sliver Hivelord:** The defensive commander. Gives all Slivers "Indestructible," making your board incredibly resilient.
*   **Sliver Gravemother:** The recursion commander. Gives your slivers "Encore," allowing you to create token copies from the graveyard for a final, massive attack.

## 2. The Core: Mana Slivers
*These slivers are the foundation of your mana base, allowing a 5-color deck to function smoothly.*
*   **Gemhide Sliver / Manaweft Sliver:** The most important slivers in the deck. They give every sliver the ability to tap for one mana of any color.
*   **Birds of Paradise:** A classic one-mana dork that taps for any color.

## 3. Offensive Slivers: Power & Evasion
*These slivers make your board a lethal threat, boosting power and making your creatures difficult to block.*
*   **Sinew Sliver / Predatory Sliver / Muscle Sliver:** The basic "lord" effects. Each gives all other Slivers +1/+1.
*   **Megantic Sliver:** A huge lord, giving all other Slivers +3/+3.
*   **Bonescythe Sliver:** Gives all Slivers "Double Strike."
*   **Cloudshredder Sliver:** Gives all Slivers Flying and Haste.
*   **Galerider Sliver / Winged Sliver:** Cheaper ways to give all your Slivers Flying.
*   **Shifting Sliver:** The ultimate evasion. Makes all Slivers unblockable unless the defending player also controls a Sliver.
*   **Horned Sliver:** Gives all Slivers Trample.
*   **Heart Sliver / Blur Sliver:** Give all Slivers Haste.
*   **Spiteful Sliver:** A strange form of offense. Whenever a Sliver is dealt damage, it deals that much damage to a target player. A great deterrent for blockers.

## 4. Defensive Slivers: Protection & Resilience
*These slivers protect your board from removal and make combat difficult for your opponents.*
*   **Crystalline Sliver:** Gives all Slivers "Shroud," preventing them from being targeted.
*   **Diffusion Sliver:** Makes opponents pay an additional 2 mana to target a Sliver.
*   **Sentinel Sliver:** Gives all Slivers Vigilance.
*   **Syphon Sliver:** Gives all Slivers Lifelink.
*   **Venom Sliver / Toxin Sliver:** Gives all Slivers Deathtouch.
*   **Root Sliver:** Makes all your Sliver spells uncounterable.
*   **Hibernation Sliver:** Allows you to pay 2 life to return a Sliver to your hand, saving it from removal.
*   **Ward Sliver:** Allows you to choose a color and give your Slivers protection from it.

## 5. Utility Slivers: The Toolbox
*These slivers provide unique and powerful effects that can be tutored up with Sliver Overlord.*
*   **Necrotic Sliver:** The ultimate removal. Allows you to sacrifice a Sliver to destroy any target permanent.
*   **Harmonic Sliver:** Destroys an artifact or enchantment whenever a Sliver enters the battlefield.
*   **Brood Sliver:** Creates a 1/1 Sliver token whenever a nontoken Sliver deals combat damage to a player.
*   **Hatchery Sliver:** Gives your slivers "Encore," similar to the Gravemother.
*   **Homing Sliver:** Gives all Sliver cards in your hand "Slivercycling," allowing you to pay 3 mana to discard it and search your library for a Sliver card.
*   **Lavabelly Sliver:** Pings a player for 1 damage or gains you 1 life whenever a Sliver enters the battlefield.
*   **Lazotep Sliver:** Gives your Slivers "Afflict," causing opponents to lose life even when they block.
*   **Quick Sliver:** Allows you to cast Sliver spells as though they had flash.
*   **Synapse Sliver:** Lets you draw a card whenever a Sliver deals combat damage to a player.
*   **Virulent Sliver:** Gives all Slivers "Poisonous 1," putting you on an alternate win condition.

## 6. Non-Sliver Support: Value & Tutors
*   **Vanquisher's Banner / Herald's Horn / Urza's Incubator:** Tribal support artifacts that make your Slivers cheaper and/or draw you cards.
*   **Descendants' Path / Guardian Project / Reflections of Littjara:** Enchantments that provide card advantage by casting creatures of the same type.
*   **Rhythm of the Wild:** Gives your creatures Haste or a +1/+1 counter and makes them uncounterable.
*   **Patriarch's Bidding:** A powerful spell that can bring back all of your dead Slivers at once.
*   **Eladamri's Call:** An instant-speed tutor for a creature.

## 7. Ramp & Mana Fixing
*   **Sol Ring / Arcane Signet:** The best artifact ramp.
*   **Chromatic Lantern / Pillar of Origins:** Artifacts that help fix your 5 colors of mana.
*   **Cultivate / Kodama's Reach / Nature's Lore / Three Visits / Farseek:** Green ramp spells that search for lands.

## 8. Interaction & Removal
*   **Swords to Plowshares / Path to Exile:** The most efficient single-target creature removal.
*   **Beast Within:** Destroys any permanent at instant speed.
*   **Blasphemous Act:** A cheap board wipe in creature-heavy games.
*   **Heroic Intervention:** Protects your board from a board wipe or targeted removal.

## 9. The Mana Base
*A 5-color mana base built on Fetch lands, Triomes, and Shock lands for perfect color fixing.*
*   **Fetch Lands (Arid Mesa, Bloodstained Mire, etc.):** The core of the mana base.
*   **Triomes (Ketria, Jetmir's Garden, etc.):** Lands that tap for three different colors.
*   **Shock Lands (Blood Crypt, Breeding Pool, etc.):** Lands that tap for two different colors.
*   **Utility Lands:** Sliver Hive, Command Tower, Path of Ancestry, Unclaimed Territory.

## Sideboard Options
*These are cards to consider swapping in to adapt to different opponents or game situations.*
*   **Amoeboid Changeling:** Can turn an opponent's creature into a Sliver, allowing you to steal it with Sliver Overlord.
*   **Coat of Arms / Door of Destinies:** More "anthem" effects if you need to go bigger.
*   **Distant Melody / Beast Whisperer:** Additional card draw engines.
*   **Training Grounds / Heartstone:** Reduce the cost of Sliver Overlord's tutoring ability.
*   **An Offer You Can't Refuse / Swan Song:** Cheap counterspells to protect your combos.
*   **Sliver Queen:** Include in the 99 if you want a token-making subtheme.

## Wishlist / Upgrade Path
*The most powerful and expensive upgrades for the deck.*
*   **Sliver Legion / Mana Echoes / Kindred Discovery / Cover of Darkness:** The best support enchantments and artifacts for the tribe.
*   **Cyclonic Rift:** The best blue board wipe.
*   **Original Dual Lands (Tundra, Underground Sea, etc.):** The absolute best, most expensive lands for a 5-color deck.
