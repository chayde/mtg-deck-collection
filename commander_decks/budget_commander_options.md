# Budget Commander Recommendations
**Target Opponent:** Karametra Angels (Selesnya Ramp/Stompy)
**Constraints:** No White, Budget Focused, Bracket 2-3 (Fun/Focused).

Here are the top 5 Commanders that fit your criteria, avoiding White and focusing on fun, interactive gameplay that can stand up to a board of Angels.

---

## 1. Henzie "Toolbox" Torre
*   **Colors:** Jund (Black / Red / Green)
*   **Theme:** Blitz / Sacrifice / Big Value
*   **Playstyle:** "Blitz" allows you to cast big creatures for reduced cost with Haste, but they die at end of turn and draw you a card. You turn your creatures into "Sorceries" that hit hard.
*   **Why it works:**
    *   **Speed:** You are faster than the Angels. You hit them before they set up.
    *   **Anti-Indestructible:** Henzie decks run sacrifice synergies. If you loop a *Plaguecrafter* or *Demon's Disciple*, you force the Angel player to sacrifice their Indestructible creatures (*Avacyn*).
    *   **Budget:** "Big dumb creatures" with bad downsides are amazing in Henzie (because you sacrifice them anyway), and they are usually 50 cents.

## 2. Araumi of the Dead Tide
*   **Colors:** Dimir (Blue / Black)
*   **Theme:** Encore / Reanimator / Graveyard
*   **Playstyle:** Fill your graveyard, then give creatures "Encore". You create 3 copies of a creature (one for each opponent) that attack and then die.
*   **Why it works:**
    *   **Value:** Encoring a *Gray Merchant of Asphodel* drains massive life. Encoring a *Ravenous Chupacabra* destroys 3 creatures.
    *   **Resilience:** Board wipes don't hurt you; they just fill your graveyard for later.
    *   **Budget:** The deck runs mostly commons and uncommons.

## 3. Lathril, Blade of the Elves
*   **Colors:** Golgari (Black / Green)
*   **Theme:** Elf Tribal / Go-Wide / Drain
*   **Playstyle:** Play lots of cheap Elves. Attack with Lathril to make more Elves. Tap 10 Elves to drain opponents for 10 life.
*   **Why it works:**
    *   **Go Wide:** Angels are big, but there are few of them. You can swarm around them.
    *   **Reach:** You don't need to attack through the Angels; you can drain life directly using Lathril's ability.
    *   **Deathtouch:** Black/Green elves often have Deathtouch, making them lethal blockers against expensive Angels.

## 4. Captain N'ghathrod
*   **Colors:** Dimir (Blue / Black)
*   **Theme:** Horrors / Mill / Theft
*   **Playstyle:** "Mind Flayer" theme. You mill opponents and steal their creatures from the graveyard.
*   **Why it works:**
    *   **Theft:** The best way to beat an *Avacyn* or *Elesh Norn* on a budget is to steal it from their graveyard for free.
    *   **Evasion:** Horrors often have "Menace" or "Fear", making them hard to block.

## 5. Raggadragga, Goreguts Boss
*   **Colors:** Gruul (Red / Green)
*   **Theme:** "Mana Dorks" Tribal / Stompy
*   **Playstyle:** Your mana dorks (*Llanowar Elves*) get +2/+2. When you cast a big spell, you untap a creature and give it +7/+7.
*   **Why it works:**
    *   **Aggro:** It makes your weak utility creatures into massive threats.
    *   **Economy:** Extremely budget friendly. The core of the deck is 10-cent mana elves.

## 🏆 Final Recommendation: Henzie "Toolbox" Torre

### The "Blitz" King
I recommend building **Henzie "Toolbox" Torre**.

**Why?**
1.  **Direct Counter to "Indestructible":** The Angel deck relies on *Avacyn* to protect its board. Henzie naturally plays cards like *Plaguecrafter*, *Demon's Disciple*, and *Grave Pact* effects. These force the opponent to **Sacrifice** creatures, which bypasses Indestructible completely.
2.  **Colors (Jund):** You get Green for Ramp (keeping up with Karametra), Black for Removal (killing Angels), and Red for Haste/Aggression. No White anywhere.
3.  **Budget Efficiency:** The deck functions perfectly with bulk rares. A $0.25 creature like *Treeshaker Chimera* becomes a powerhouse engine in Henzie. You don't need expensive staples to make it hum.
4.  **Fun Factor:** It feels like throwing giant monsters at your opponent. It's high-energy and keeps the game moving, which contrasts nicely with the slower, setup-heavy Angel deck.

**Sample "Blitz" Interactions:**
*   **Daemogoth Woe-Eater:** 4-mana 7/6. Blitz it out -> Hit for 7 -> It dies -> Draw a card -> Opponent discards a card. Cost: ~$0.50.
*   **Industrial Advancement:** When a blitzed creature dies, reveal cards until you find another creature and put it into play. Value train!
