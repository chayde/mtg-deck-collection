# Henzie "Toolbox" Torre Deck Guide: "Budget Blitz"

## Deck Strategy
**Archetype:** Jund (Black/Red/Green) Midrange/Sacrifice
**Focus:** Blitz, Sacrifice Value, Graveyard Recursion

*   **Goal:** This deck is a fast and aggressive "Monster Truck" that aims to run over opponents with value. The goal is to cast Henzie on Turn 2 or 3, then start "Blitzing" big creatures every turn. Blitz gives them Haste and draws you a card when they die, turning every creature into a valuable, one-shot effect.
*   **How it Plays:** You'll use your ramp to get Henzie out as early as possible. From there, you'll blitz out creatures with powerful "Enter the Battlefield" (ETB) and "Death" triggers. At the end of your turn, the blitzed creature will die, triggering even more abilities and drawing you a card. The deck uses sacrifice and recursion synergies to generate massive advantage.

## 1. The Commander
*   **Henzie "Toolbox" Torre:** He gives all of your creatures with mana value 4 or greater Blitz, and he reduces their Blitz cost each time you cast him from the command zone.

## 2. The "Blitz" Brigade
*The core of the deck. These creatures provide powerful effects when they enter the battlefield or die.*
*   **Forced Sacrifice (Plaguecrafter, Demon's Disciple, Gravelighter):** A suite of creatures that force each player to sacrifice a creature when they enter. This is a great way to deal with indestructible or hexproof threats.
*   **Removal on a Stick (Ravenous Chupacabra, Noxious Gearhulk):** Creatures that destroy a creature when they enter the battlefield.
*   **Value Creatures (Solemn Simulacrum, Timeless Witness):** Creatures that provide ramp, card draw, or recursion.
*   **Big Finishers (Etali, Primal Storm, Woodfall Primus, Sepulchral Primordial):** Powerful creatures that can take over the game if they stick around or generate huge value when blitzed.
*   **Recursion & Reanimation (Feldon of the Third Path, Junji, the Midnight Sky):** Creatures that can bring back other creatures from your graveyard.

## 3. Value Engines
*Enchantments and artifacts that generate value from your creatures entering and dying.*
*   **Garruk's Uprising:** Gives your creatures trample and draws you a card whenever a large creature enters the battlefield.
*   **Industrial Advancement:** A powerful enchantment that lets you sacrifice a blitzed creature at the end of your turn to cheat another, potentially larger creature into play for free.
*   **Deathreap Ritual / Moldervine Reclamation:** Enchantments that draw you cards whenever your creatures die.
*   **Warstorm Surge:** An enchantment that turns every creature you play into a direct damage spell, often acting as a win condition.
*   **Grave Pact / Butcher of Malakir:** A powerful enchantment (or creature) that forces your opponents to sacrifice a creature whenever one of your creatures dies.

## 4. Recursion
*Spells to bring your creatures back from the graveyard for another round of blitzing.*
*   **Victimize:** An incredibly efficient spell that sacrifices one creature to bring back two others from your graveyard.
*   **Living Death:** A massive board wipe and reanimation spell that can win the game on the spot.
*   **Cauldron of Souls:** An artifact that can give your creatures Persist, allowing them to come back immediately after being sacrificed at the end of a blitz.

## 5. Ramp
*A crucial package of ramp to cast Henzie early and consistently.*
*   **Mana Dorks (Llanowar Elves, Elvish Mystic, etc.):** A suite of one-mana creatures that tap for mana.
*   **Ramp Spells (Rampant Growth, Farseek, Nature's Lore):** Spells that search for lands to accelerate your mana.
*   **Mana Rocks (Sol Ring, Arcane Signet):** The most efficient mana rocks in the format.
