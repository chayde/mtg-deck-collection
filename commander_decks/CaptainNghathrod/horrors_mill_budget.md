# Captain N'ghathrod Deck Guide: "Budget Horror Mill"

## Deck Strategy
**Archetype:** Dimir (Blue/Black) Horror Tribal / Mill / Theft
**Focus:** Horror Tribal, Combat Mill, Reanimator

*   **Goal:** The deck's goal is to leverage Captain N'ghathrod's abilities to mill your opponents and then steal their best creatures. You win by turning your opponents' greatest strengths against them.
*   **How it Plays:** The early game is focused on deploying evasive Horrors and setting up your mill engines. Once Captain N'ghathrod is in play, you'll start attacking to trigger his powerful mill ability. At the end of your turn, you'll reanimate the best creature you milled, building a powerful and unexpected board state from your opponents' decks.

## 1. The Commander
*   **Captain N'ghathrod:** He is the heart of the deck. He gives all of your Horrors menace, making them difficult to block, and mills your opponents whenever they are dealt combat damage by a Horror. His final ability is the payoff: reanimating a creature from an opponent's graveyard for free.

## 2. The Horror Squad
*A collection of evasive and powerful Horrors to trigger the Captain's abilities.*
*   **Consuming Aberration:** The MVP of the deck. It mills an opponent whenever you cast a spell and grows to a massive size based on the number of cards in your opponents' graveyards.
*   **Hullbreaker Horror:** A powerhouse control piece that can bounce spells and permanents, giving you a huge tempo advantage.
*   **Nemesis of Reason:** Mills an opponent for 10 cards whenever it attacks.
*   **Brainstealer Dragon:** A flying horror that lets you play cards from the top of your opponents' libraries.
*   **Mind Flayer:** Permanently steals a creature from an opponent.
*   **Zellix, Sanity Flayer:** Creates more Horror tokens whenever an opponent mills a creature, fueling your army.
*   **Changeling Outcast:** An unblockable one-drop that is also a Horror, making it a perfect early-game threat.

## 3. The Mill Engine
*Spells to accelerate your milling plan and fuel your graveyard theft.*
*   **Maddening Cacophony / Fractured Sanity / Cut Your Losses:** Powerful, one-shot mill spells that can take a huge chunk out of an opponent's library.
*   **Mindcrank:** An artifact that causes an opponent to mill whenever they take damage.
*   **Mesmeric Orb:** A powerful artifact that mills every player whenever they untap a permanent.
*   **Breach the Multiverse:** A massive finisher that mills every player and then lets you reanimate a creature or planeswalker from each graveyard.

## 4. Interaction & Protection
*Spells to protect your board and interact with your opponents.*
*   **Counterspell / Negate / Arcane Denial:** A solid package of counterspells.
*   **Feed the Swarm / Infernal Grasp / Pongify:** Efficient single-target removal.
*   **Propaganda:** A powerful enchantment that makes it difficult for your opponents to attack you back.
*   **Swiftfoot Boots / Lightning Greaves:** Essential equipment to protect Captain N'ghathrod and give him haste.

## 5. Ramp
*A package of mana rocks to accelerate your game plan.*
