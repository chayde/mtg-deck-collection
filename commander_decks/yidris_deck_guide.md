# Yidris Deck Guide: "The Maelstrom Engine"

## Commander Strategy
**Yidris, Maelstrom Wielder**
*   **Role:** The Enabler.
*   **Goal:** He MUST deal combat damage to a player.
*   **The Reward:** Spells you cast from your hand in Main Phase 2 gain **Cascade**. This effectively doubles the value of every card in your hand.

---

## 1. The "Jackpot" Cards (0-Mana Suspend)
*These cards have no mana cost. You cannot cast them normally. You usually have to "Suspend" them and wait 4 turns. However, **Cascade** says "cast without paying its mana cost."*
*   **Why included:** If you cast a 1 or 2 mana spell with Cascade, you will skip all 1-drops and HIT THESE GUARANTEED.
*   **Ancestral Vision:** "Draw 3 cards." (The best card in the deck. Refills your hand to keep cascading.)
*   **Wheel of Fate:** "Discard hand, draw 7." (Disrupts opponents and refills your hand.)
*   **Profane Tutor:** "Search for any card." (Finds your win condition for free.)
*   **Inevitable Betrayal:** "Search opponent's library for a creature and put it into play." (Target the player with the best deck. Steal their Avacyn or Craterhoof Behemoth.)
*   **Living End:** "Swap all graveyards and creatures in play." (A board wipe that brings back your dead stuff. Use carefully!)

## 2. Making Yidris Hit (Evasion & Protection)
*Yidris has no built-in evasion. If he gets blocked, the deck does nothing.*
*   **Lightning Greaves / Swiftfoot Boots:** Give Haste (attack immediately) and Shroud/Hexproof (can't be killed by spot removal).
*   **Whispersilk Cloak:** Makes Yidris **Unblockable** and Shrouded. The best equipment in the deck.
*   **Rogue's Passage:** A land that makes him unblockable. Hard to counter.
*   **Shizo, Death's Storehouse:** Gives him "Fear" (can only be blocked by Black/Artifact creatures).
*   **Bear Umbra:** An aura that untaps all your lands when you attack.
    *   *Trick:* Cast Yidris -> Next turn Equip Umbra -> Attack -> Lands Untap -> You now have double mana to cast spells in Main Phase 2!
*   **Sword of Feast and Famine:** Similar to Bear Umbra. Untaps lands and gives protection from Green/Black (common blocker colors).

---

## 3. Extra Combat (The Multiplier)
*   **Interaction:** If Yidris hits a player **twice** in one turn, spells gain Cascade **twice**.
*   **Seize the Day:** Grants an extra combat step. It has "Flashback," so you can cast it again from the graveyard.
*   **Relentless Assault:** Simple extra combat step.
*   **Karlach, Fury of Avernus:** Gives extra combat just by attacking. Also a solid body.
*   **Moraug, Fury of Akoum:** Landfall triggers extra combat.
    *   *Synergy:* Fetch lands trigger this twice!

---

## 4. The "Cascade Chain" (Big Spells)
*These are the cards you cast in Main Phase 2 to start the chain.*
*   **Maelstrom Wanderer:** Cascades twice on its own. If Yidris triggered, it Cascades **THREE** times. Gives your whole team Haste.
*   **Apex Devastator:** "Cascade, Cascade, Cascade, Cascade." A 10-drop that effectively casts 5 spells for free.
*   **Imoti, Celebrant of Bounty:** Gives your big spells (CMC 6+) Cascade.
*   **Etali, Primal Storm:** When it attacks, you cast the top card of EVERY player's deck for free.
*   **Etherium-Horn Sorcerer:** A creature with Cascade that can bounce itself to your hand.
    *   *Trick:* Cast it -> Cascade -> Pay {1}{U}{R} to return to hand -> Cast it again next turn for more Cascade.

---

## 5. Delve Spells (The "Cheat" Codes)
*These cards have a very high Mana Value (CMC) but can be cast for very little mana by exiling cards from your graveyard.*
*   **Dig Through Time:** CMC is 8. You can cast it for {U}{U} (2 mana).
    *   *Result:* You pay 2 mana, look at the top 7 cards, keep 2... AND you Cascade looking for a 7-drop spell!
*   **Treasure Cruise:** CMC is 8. Cast for {U}. Draws 3 cards and finds you a free 7-drop.

---

## 6. Value Engines & Synergies
*   **Nalfeshnee:** Whenever you cast a spell from exile (which Cascade does!), you copy it. This doubles all your free spells.
*   **Keeper of Secrets:** Whenever you cast a spell from exile, it deals damage equal to that spell's CMC to an opponent. This turns your value into a win condition.
*   **Prosper, Tome-Bound:** Creates a Treasure token every time you Cascade.
*   **Wandering Archaic:** Forces opponents to pay {2} or let you copy their instants/sorceries.
*   **Averna, the Chaos Bloom:** Fixes the "Land Problem." Normally, if you cascade into a Land, you skip it. Averna puts that land onto the battlefield tapped. Ramps you huge.
*   **Passionate Archaeologist:** A Background. Whenever you cast a spell from exile, it deals damage to an opponent equal to that spell's CMC.

---

## 7. Interaction (Removal)
*   **Delayed Blast Fireball:**
    *   *Normal:* Deals 2 damage to opponents' creatures.
    *   *Cascaded:* If cast from exile (Cascade), it deals **5 damage** instead. This is a one-sided board wipe that kills almost everything.
*   **Hurl Through Hell:** Exiles a creature instantly. Then, you can cast it for free.
*   **Chaos Warp:** Removes ANYTHING (Land, Enchantment, Indestructible Creature).
*   **Toxic Deluge:** The best board wipe. You pay life to give -X/-X. Kills Indestructible creatures.
*   **Blasphemous Act:**
    *   *The Trick:* It costs {R} if the board is full, but its **Mana Value is 9**.
    *   If you cast it for {R} after Yidris hits, you wipe the board AND Cascade searching for an 8-drop!

---

## 8. Card Draw & Manipulation
*   **Brainstorm:**
    *   *Trick:* Draw 3, put 2 cards **from your hand on top of your deck**.
    *   Put a big spell (like *Ancestral Vision* or *Maelstrom Wanderer*) on top, then cast a small spell to Cascade directly into it!
*   **Rhystic Study / Sylvan Library:** Steady card advantage.
*   **Rishkar's Expertise:** Draw cards equal to Yidris's power, then cast a free spell (triggering Cascade).

## 9. The Mana Base (Fetch Lands)
*We upgraded to a full Fetch Land package.*
*   **Polluted Delta, Wooded Foothills, etc.:** These find your **Triomes** (Zagoth, Ketria, etc.) or **Shock Lands** (Breeding Pool, etc.).
*   **Why it matters:**
    1.  **Perfect Fixing:** You will never be color-screwed.
    2.  **Shuffle:** You can shuffle away bad cards you saw with *Sylvan Library* or *Brainstorm*.
    3.  **Delve Fuel:** Every fetch land in the graveyard makes *Dig Through Time* and *Treasure Cruise* cheaper.
