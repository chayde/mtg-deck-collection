# Yidris, The Maelstrom Engine (Combat & Cascade)
**Commander:** Yidris, Maelstrom Wielder
**Colors:** Blue / Black / Red / Green (Not White)
**Power Level:** Bracket 2-3 (Optimized)
**Budget:** ~$500 USD
**Archetype:** Combat / Value Cascade / Big Spells

## Deck Overview
This deck is not a "Storm" deck that takes 20-minute turns. It is a **"combat-step"** deck.
1.  **Ramp:** Get Yidris out on Turn 3 or 4.
2.  **Connect:** Give Yidris Haste or Unblockable to deal combat damage.
3.  **Explode:** In your second main phase, cast big spells. Yidris gives them Cascade.
4.  **Jackpot:** The deck is tuned so that your Cascades hit "0 Mana" suspend spells for massive value.
