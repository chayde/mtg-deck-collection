# Rafiq Deck Guide: "The Exalted Blade (Premium)"

## Commander Strategy
**Rafiq of the Many**
*   **Role:** The Finisher.
*   **Goal:** Attack with a single creature while Rafiq is on the board.
*   **The Reward:** That creature gets +1/+1 for each other creature with "Exalted" you control. More importantly, as long as it's attacking alone, Rafiq gives it **Double Strike**. This allows for massive, one-shot commander damage kills.

## 1. The Core Engine: Exalted
*These cards provide the "Exalted" keyword, which is the backbone of the deck. Each one of these on the battlefield adds +1/+1 to your lone attacker.*
*   **Noble Hierarch:** The best Exalted creature. It's also a mana dork that taps for any of our colors.
*   **Sublime Archangel:** A major upgrade. She has Exalted and gives every other creature you control Exalted. This makes your board explode in power.
*   **Finest Hour:** The most powerful Exalted enchantment. It gives you an additional combat step if a creature attacked alone, allowing you to trigger Rafiq's double strike twice in one turn.
*   **Qasali Pridemage:** An Exalted creature that can be sacrificed to destroy an artifact or enchantment.
*   **Cathedral of War:** A land that has Exalted.

## 2. Protection & Evasion
*Rafiq is a lightning rod for removal. You must protect him and ensure he can get past blockers.*
*   **Mother of Runes / Giver of Runes:** Can give Rafiq protection from a chosen color, making him unblockable and immune to targeted removal of that color.
*   **Swiftfoot Boots / Lightning Greaves:** Give Haste and Hexproof/Shroud, protecting from removal and allowing Rafiq to attack immediately.
*   **Robe of Stars:** Can make Rafiq "phase out," which is one of the best ways to dodge board wipes.
*   **Unbreakable Formation:** Can make your entire board indestructible for a turn.
*   **Whispersilk Cloak:** Makes Rafiq unblockable and gives him shroud.
*   **Rogue's Passage:** A land that can make a creature unblockable.
*   **Bower Passage:** Prevents your creatures from being blocked except by creatures with flying or reach.

## 3. Buffs: Equipment & Auras
*These cards make Rafiq a truly terrifying threat, often capable of one-shotting an opponent.*
*   **Colossus Hammer:** A massive +10/+10 buff. With Rafiq's double strike, this is often lethal.
*   **Blackblade Reforged:** Gives +1/+1 for each land you control.
*   **Sword of Hearth and Home:** A premium upgrade. It provides protection, ramps you by putting a land onto the battlefield, and flickers a creature.
*   **Shield of the Oversoul / Steel of the Godhead:** Powerful auras that give protection, indestructibility, lifelink, and make Rafiq unblockable. Steel of the Godhead is often the primary finisher.
*   **Rancor:** A classic aura that gives Trample and comes back to your hand if it goes to the graveyard.
*   **Sovereigns of Lost Alara:** When you attack with a lone creature, you can tutor an aura from your deck and attach it for free.

## 4. Knight & Paladin Synergy
*A sub-theme that provides powerful lords and support for many of the deck's key creatures.*
*   **Knight Exemplar:** Makes all your other Knights indestructible.
*   **Silverblade Paladin:** Can give another creature Double Strike.
*   **Kinsbaile Cavalier:** Gives all your Knights Double Strike.
*   **Mirran Crusader:** Has protection from Green and Black and has Double Strike on its own.
*   **Puresteel Paladin:** Lets you draw cards when you play equipment and can make your equip costs zero.
*   **Danitha, New Benalia's Light:** A vigilant, lifelinking threat that makes auras and equipment cheaper to cast.

## 5. Ramp & Mana Fixing
*Getting to four mana for Rafiq is critical. This package ensures you can do it quickly and with the right colors.*
*   **Sol Ring / Arcane Signet / Azorius Signet:** Standard artifact ramp.
*   **Birds of Paradise / Avacyn's Pilgrim:** One-mana dorks that produce our required colors.
*   **Bloom Tender:** A significant upgrade. Can tap for one mana of each color among permanents you control. In this deck, it frequently taps for three mana.
*   **Sanctum Weaver:** Can produce a large amount of mana based on your board state.

## 6. Card Draw
*Voltron decks can run out of gas quickly. These cards help keep your hand full.*
*   **Sram, Senior Edificer:** Lets you draw a card whenever you cast an Aura, Equipment, or Vehicle spell.
*   **Mystic Remora:** A premium draw engine that can draw you a huge number of cards for a very low mana investment.
*   **Toski, Bearer of Secrets:** An indestructible, uncounterable squirrel that draws you a card whenever any of your creatures deals combat damage to a player.
*   **Cold-Eyed Selkie:** When it deals combat damage to a player, you draw that many cards. A perfect fit for an Exalted deck.
*   **Hunter's Insight:** An instant that can draw a huge number of cards after Rafiq deals damage.

## 7. Interaction & Removal
*Answers to your opponents' threats.*
*   **Bant Charm:** A flexible charm that can counter an instant, destroy an artifact, or put a creature on the bottom of its owner's library.
*   **Path to Exile / Swords to Plowshares:** The most efficient single-target creature removal spells ever printed.
*   **Beast Within / Generous Gift:** Destroy any permanent at instant speed.
*   **Counterspell / Dovin's Veto:** Classic counterspells to protect Rafiq or stop a game-winning threat.
*   **Qasali Pridemage / Knight of Autumn:** Flexible creatures that can destroy artifacts or enchantments.

## 8. The Mana Base (Premium)
*The mana base is significantly upgraded with Fetch Lands to ensure perfect color fixing.*
*   **Fetch Lands:** Flooded Strand, Misty Rainforest, and Windswept Heath allow you to search your library for any land with a basic land type, like your Shock Lands or Triomes.
*   **Shock Lands & Triomes:** Breeding Pool, Hallowed Fountain, Temple Garden, and Spara's Headquarters.
*   **Utility Lands:** Cathedral of War provides Exalted. Rogue's Passage makes a creature unblockable. Scavenger Grounds can exile graveyards.
