# Project Context: Magic: The Gathering Deck Collection

## 1. Project Overview
This directory serves as a knowledge base and tracker for the user's Magic: The Gathering activities. It contains deck lists, strategy guides, upgrade paths, and collection data for both Paper Magic (Commander/EDH) and MTG Arena.

**Primary Goal:** To organize deck ideas, track meta changes, and plan card crafting/purchasing decisions.

## 2. Directory Structure & Key Files

### 📂 Root Directory
*   **`README.md`**: The primary index of the project (Note: may need updates as new decks are added).
*   **`history.md`**: A chronological log of conversations, decisions, and match history. **Crucial** for understanding recent user choices (e.g., "Why did we pick Dimir Midrange?").
*   **`GEMINI.md`**: This file. Context for AI agents.
*   **`thalia_gitrog_abzan*.md`**: A series of deck lists (Budget, Premium, Final) for a "Thalia and The Gitrog Monster" Commander deck. (Note: These are currently in the root, unlike other Commander decks).

### 📂 `/commander_decks`
Dedicated folder for Paper Commander (EDH) lists.
*   **`TheHive-Slivers.md`**: 5-Color Slivers (User's main deck).
*   **`yidris_chaos_cascade.md`**: Yidris Cascade strategy.
*   **`karametra_angels_ramp_premium.md`**: Reference list for a Selesnya Angels deck.

### 📂 `/arena_decks`
Dedicated folder for MTG Arena (60-card formats like Standard, Historic, Timeless).
*   **`dimir_midrange.md`**: Current active Standard deck project.
*   **`arena_collection.csv`**: A CSV export or tracked list of the user's digital card collection.
*   **`*.md`**: Various other archetype lists (Simic Omniscience, Jeskai Artifacts, etc.).

## 3. Usage Guidelines

### Reading Deck Lists
*   Deck files are typically Markdown (`.md`).
*   They often contain a "Moxfield Import" section at the bottom for easy copying.
*   They track "Budget" vs "Premium" versions to help with financial planning (Gold/Gems/Cash).

### Maintenance
*   **New Decks:** When creating a new deck list, prefer placing it in the appropriate subdirectory (`/commander_decks` or `/arena_decks`) rather than the root.
*   **History:** Check `history.md` before making suggestions to ensure consistency with previous advice (e.g., don't suggest a deck the user already rejected).
*   **Updates:** If the user crafts cards or changes a deck, update the corresponding `.md` file to reflect the new "Current State".

## 4. User Preferences (Inferred)
*   **Formats:** Paper Commander (EDH) and MTG Arena (Standard/Historic).
*   **Playstyle:** Enjoys complex interactions (Cascade, Landfall), Tribal strategies (Slivers), and Midrange/Control (Dimir). Dislikes linear Aggro (Mono-Red).
*   **Resources:** "Wildcard Rich" on Arena, willing to optimize.
